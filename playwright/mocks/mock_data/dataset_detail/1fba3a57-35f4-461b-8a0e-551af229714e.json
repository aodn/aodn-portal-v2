For information on using the data from the NRS stations please refer to Eriksen et al. 2019. It is advised that anyone using this data should read this methodology or contact the project contact person to understand the nuances of each sampling and analysis chain. \\n\\nThe data are made available in binned products for ease of use. As taxonomy changes over time and the ability of analysts improves with training more and more species can be identified over time. The products account for these changes and for real absences from the samples. A 0 abundance means that the species was looked for and not seen, null (empty cell) means that the species was not looked for in that sample. The products are therefore applicable for use in time series analysis. \\n\\nThere are a total of 7 products to choose from. \\nZooplankton abundance products are available at 5 levels: \\nRaw product (includes all data) \\nCopepods product (all data where species have been identified, Copepods only) \\nNon-Copepods product (all data where species have been identified, non-Copepods only)\\nGenus product (includes all data binned to genus level) \\nHigher taxonomic group (includes all data binned to functional groups).\\n(each of these products includes the total biomass per samples)\\nPlus\\nDerived indices – NRS only (useful indices at sample level for NRS data)\\nDepth Binned CTD Data – NRS only (NRS CTD data binned to 1m and matched to TripCode)\\n\\nPlankton abundances were originally provided on the AODN Portal only as raw data, in flat table form (with each species recorded in a separate row), without any adjustments for taxonomy changes or real absences. \\nThe first version of the \\\"analysis-ready\\\" products were first published on 04/04/2019.

In light of this fundamental importance the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) has designated microbial biomass and diversity as emerging essential ocean variables (EOV) and a necessary component of an integrated and sustained ocean observing system. The IMOS Marine Microbiome Initiative Facility facilitates the delivery of DNA-based data on the distribution, diversity and function of marine microbes in Australian coastal waters and oceans through the collection and processing of water samples from the IMOS National Reference Stations (NRS) and a newly established network of coastal sites. \\n\\nIMOS NRS are a series of sites designed to monitor oceanographic parameters in Australian coastal ocean waters using moored sensors and water sampling field trips. These sites span ~30° of latitude and ~38° longitude, range from tropical to cold temperate zones, and are influenced by both local and globally significant oceanographic and climatic features. Water samples are collected monthly from several depths at the 7 current NRS, Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Rottnest Island (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking (NSW), establishing a globally unique continental-scale time-series (since 2012 for some NRS) of the marine microbial communities in Australian coastal and shelf waters. \\n\\nThe IMOS Coastal Sampling sub-Facility is a network of coastal microbial observatories designed to operationally mirror the NRS, but provide novel capacity to understand coastal microbial processes. Coastal environments are highly dynamic due to both natural perturbations and anthropogenic impacts and represent sites where environmental microbial assemblages can have substantial human health and economic impacts. Phase 1 of establishing this network designated three sites of significance based on stakeholder/end user feedback, economic importance, and/or human health and scientific relevance. Sampling sites include coastal waters of the Great Barrier Reef (QLD), Botany Bay (NSW), and Port Phillip Bay (VIC). \\n\\nData is generated and made available through the Australian Microbiome Initiative, a national bio-resource, providing a searchable database of marine microbial occurrence data. This is an Australian wide collaboration founded on two established Bioplatforms Australia framework data initiatives: Marine Microbes and Biomes of Australian Soil Environments (BASE). The consortium involves researchers from more than 40 institutions supported by the following core partners: Bioplatforms Australia; Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS); CSIRO and Parks Australia through the Bush Blitz program. The DNA-based data generated by this facility provide crucial spatial and temporal information that underpin the understanding of Australian marine microbiology. Coupled with the suite of biological, physical and chemical observations already established at IMOS National Reference Stations, the Marine Microbiome Initiative supports the understanding of status and trends of oceanic health, biogeochemistry and primary productivity. \\n\\nThis data is freely available through the Bioplatforms Australia Data Portal (About - The Australian Microbiome Initiative - Organizations - data.bioplatforms.com) including the raw data files as well as processed data products in the form of microbial DNA-sequence based occurrence tables and metagenomics gene maps (gene maps currently in development).

Autonomous ocean gliders can be built relatively cheaply, are controlled remotely and are reusable allowing them to make repeated subsurface ocean observations at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods. The data retrieved from the glider fleet will contribute to the study of the major boundary current systems surrounding Australia and their links to coastal ecosystems.\\n\\nThe ANFOG glider fleet consists of two types; Slocum gliders and Seagliders. \\nSlocum gliders (named for Joshua Slocum, the first solo global circumnavigator), manufactured by Webb Research Corp are optimised for shallow coastal waters (<200m) where high manoeuvrability is needed. ANFOG will have Slocum gliders for deployment on the continental shelf. Seagliders, built at the University of Washington, are designed to operate more efficiently in the open ocean up to 1000m water depth. ANFOG uses their Seagliders to monitor the boundary currents and continental shelves, which is valuable for gathering long-term environmental records of physical, chemical and biological data not widely measured to date. Whilst the Slocum gliders, due to their low cost and operational flexibility, will be of great use in intensive coastal monitoring, both types of gliders weigh only 52kg, enabling them to be launched from small boats. They have a suite of sensors able to record temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll against position and depth\\n\\nThe use of these contemporary gliders provides a unique opportunity to effectively measure the boundary currents off Australia, which are the main link between open-ocean and coastal processes. A number of gliders are operated with target regions including the Coral Sea, East Australian Current off New South Wales and Tasmania, Southern Ocean southwest of Tasmania, the Leeuwin and Capes Currents off South Western Australia and the Pilbara and Kimberly regions off North Western Australia.\"}"

A 'sensor network' is an array of small, wirelessly interconnected sensors that collectively stream sensor data to a central data aggregation point. Sensor networks can be used to provide spatially dense bio-physical measurements in real-time. In the marine environment they have particular application to the study of benthic ecosystems. Some sensors can be set to sample according to prevailing conditions (e.g. monitoring salinity more frequently after rainfall), but since communications with the sensors can be bi-directional they can also be manipulated by central land-based control systems. FAIMMS sensors collect data related to the interaction of heat and light in coral bleaching, and to help understand the impact of upwelling from the Coral Sea upon the productivity of Great Barrier Reef ecosystems. While sensor networks are a leading edge technology, they are well suited to this application because proven technologies exist for reliable sensing of physical variables (e.g. temperature, salinity, light) critical to the immediate scientific questions, which are: 1. understanding the interaction of heat and light in coral bleaching, and 2. understanding the impact of upwelling from the Coral Sea upon the productivity of GBR ecosystems. The immediate value of the network will be its ability to return spatially dense bio-physical measurements in real-time. As such this represents a large scale trial or \\\"proof of concept\\\" of a very important emerging technology for application in the marine environment with particular relevance to benthic ecosystems such as Great Barrier Reef and other benthic environments. Some sites have been partially or fully decommissioned in regards to IMOS: Heron Island (2008 - present) - partial; One Tree Island (2008 - present) - partial; Davies Reef (2009 - 2018); Myrmidon Reef (2009 - 2015); Rib Reef (2009 - 2017); Orpheus Island (2009 - present); Lizard Island (2010 - present) - partial. In some circumstances the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), has taken over the operation of the site, or equipment within it (see http://imos.org.au/wirelesssensornetworks.html for more details), and IMOS will continue to pull data from them.\"}"

      "title": "{\"title\":\"IMOS - Facility for Automated Intelligent Monitoring of Marine Systems (FAIMMS)\",\"recordAbstract\":\"The IMOS Facility for Intelligent Monitoring of Marine Systems is a sensor network established in the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland, Australia. A 'sensor network' is an array of small, wirelessly interconnected sensors that collectively stream sensor data to a central data aggregation point. Sensor networks can be used to provide spatially dense bio-physical measurements in real-time. In the marine environment they have particular application to the study of benthic ecosystems. Some sensors can be set to sample according to prevailing conditions (e.g. monitoring salinity more frequently after rainfall), but since communications with the sensors can be bi-directional they can also be manipulated by central land-based control systems. FAIMMS sensors collect data related to the interaction of heat and light in coral bleaching, and to help understand the impact of upwelling from the Coral Sea upon the productivity of Great Barrier Reef ecosystems. While sensor networks are a leading edge technology, they are well suited to this application because proven technologies exist for reliable sensing of physical variables (e.g. temperature, salinity, light) critical to the immediate scientific questions, which are: 1. understanding the interaction of heat and light in coral bleaching, and 2. understanding the impact of upwelling from the Coral Sea upon the productivity of GBR ecosystems. The immediate value of the network will be its ability to return spatially dense bio-physical measurements in real-time. As such this represents a large scale trial or \\\"proof of concept\\\" of a very important emerging technology for application in the marine environment with particular relevance to benthic ecosystems such as Great Barrier Reef and other benthic environments. Some sites have been partially or fully decommissioned in regards to IMOS: Heron Island (2008 - present) - partial; One Tree Island (2008 - present) - partial; Davies Reef (2009 - 2018); Myrmidon Reef (2009 - 2015); Rib Reef (2009 - 2017); Orpheus Island (2009 - present); Lizard Island (2010 - present) - partial. In some circumstances the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), has taken over the operation of the site, or equipment within it (see http://imos.org.au/wirelesssensornetworks.html for more details), and IMOS will continue to pull data from them.\"}"

Autonomous ocean gliders can be built relatively cheaply, are controlled remotely and are reusable allowing them to make repeated subsurface ocean observations at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods. The data retrieved from the glider fleet will contribute to the study of the major boundary current systems surrounding Australia and their links to coastal ecosystems.\\n\\nThe ANFOG glider fleet consists of two types; Slocum gliders and Seagliders. \\nSlocum gliders (named for Joshua Slocum, the first solo global circumnavigator), manufactured by Webb Research Corp are optimised for shallow coastal waters (<200m) where high manoeuvrability is needed. ANFOG will have Slocum gliders for deployment on the continental shelf. Seagliders, built at the University of Washington, are designed to operate more efficiently in the open ocean up to 1000m water depth. ANFOG uses their Seagliders to monitor the boundary currents and continental shelves, which is valuable for gathering long-term environmental records of physical, chemical and biological data not widely measured to date. Whilst the Slocum gliders, due to their low cost and operational flexibility, will be of great use in intensive coastal monitoring, both types of gliders weigh only 52kg, enabling them to be launched from small boats. They have a suite of sensors able to record temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll against position and depth\\n\\nThe use of these contemporary gliders provides a unique opportunity to effectively measure the boundary currents off Australia, which are the main link between open-ocean and coastal processes. A number of gliders are operated with target regions including the Coral Sea, East Australian Current off New South Wales and Tasmania, Southern Ocean southwest of Tasmania, the Leeuwin and Capes Currents off South Western Australia and the Pilbara and Kimberly regions off North Western Australia.\"}"
