    "ai:description": "The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), most typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water. Modelling is then used to compute an estimate of the Net Primary Productivity (NPP).\n\nThe model used is based on the standard vertically generalised production model (VGPM). The VGPM is a \"chlorophyll-based\" model that estimates net primary production from chlorophyll using a temperature-dependent description of chlorophyll-specific photosynthetic efficiency. For the VGPM, net primary production is a function of chlorophyll, available light, and the photosynthetic efficiency. The only difference between the Standard VGPM and the Eppley-VGPM is the temperature-dependent description of photosynthetic efficiencies, with the Eppley approach using an exponential function to account for variation in photosynthetic efficiencies due to photoacclimation. The similarity between these models (VGPM vs E_VGPM) is described more extensively in a paper by Elena-Carr et al (2006.). VGPM is a Depth Integrated Model(DIM) described by Behrenfeld and Falkowski (1997), with modification due to Eppley (1972) as implemented by Antoine and Morel (1996).\n\nThere are multiple retrieval algorithms for estimating Chl-a. These data (eppley_npp_chl_gsm) use the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM) method implemented in the SeaDAS processing software l2gen and described in \"Chapter 11, and references therein, of IOCCG Report 5, 2006, (http://ioccg.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ioccg-report-05.pdf). This product is recommended for use in the VGPM model. The product Eppley_NPP_chl_gsm is experimental, in the sense that it is challenging to validate due to the scarcity of insitu measurments. It should only be used with caution informed by understanding of the algorithms.\n\nProduction of contemporary MODIS data ceased at 2024/12/26. Users requiring similar Ocean Colour Radiometry data beyond 2024 should consider the VIIRS instruments on the SNPP and NOAA20+ series of satellites, also provided by IMOS.",

    "statement": "The radiometric sensitivity of the MODIS sensor is evolving continuously during its mission and is monitored regularly by NASA. The SeaDAS software uses tables of calibration coefficients that are updated periodically. From time to time upgrades to the algorithms and/or the format of the calibration tables are required, in which case a new version of SeaDAS is released. These data were updated on 1 September 2020 to use processing in SeaDAS v7.5 and between 2002/07/04 and 2022/06/30 are consistent with the R2018.0 reprocessing (https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/reprocessing/r2018/aqua/). Data between 2022/07/01-2023/01/31 and then from 2023/02/01 onwards, have been processed with two more recent releases of SeaDAS and are yet to be fully verified for consistency with NASA’s most recent processing(s). Production of contemporary MODIS data ceased at 2024/12/26.  \n\nUsers requiring similar Ocean Colour Radiometry data beyond 2024 should consider the VIIRS instruments on the SNPP and NOAA20+ series of satellites, also provided by IMOS.\nIt is anticipated that during 2025 IMOS will complete a reprocessing of the entire MODIS archive from 2002/07/04 – 2024/12/26 that will be consistent throughout with the latest recommended NASA processing version.  \n\nThe data are produced by combining the near real time (nrt) data stream from all the available direct broadcast reception stations in Australia with delayed-mode data from NASA in the US. The data have been remapped from satellite projection into a geographic (Latitude/Longitude axes) projection (0.01 degree sampling) and are presented as a sequence of daily mosaics covering the region (80 <= Longitude <= 180, -60 <= Latitude <= +10) formatted as CF-compliant netCDF files. It should be noted that the data are not processed until the definitive spacecraft ephemeris becomes available, usually 12-24 hours after the overpass. This means that the geolocation should be of a uniformly high standard.\n\nThe filenames are of the form A.P1D.<yyyymmdd>T<hhmmss>Z.<region>.<productname>.nc, where 'A\" denotes the Aqua/MODIS sensor, 'P1D' is a period of 1 day, '<yyyymmdd>T<hhmmss>Z' is the UTC date+time of the centre of the compositing interval, '<region>' is the area covered (normally 'aust' for Australasia). '<productname>' is the name of the data product and 'nc' denotes a netCDF format file. Files are written in netCDF4 format with compression.",

  "description": "The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), most typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water. Modelling is then used to compute an estimate of the Net Primary Productivity (NPP).\n\nThe model used is based on the standard vertically generalised production model (VGPM).  The VGPM is a \"chlorophyll-based\" model that estimates net primary production from chlorophyll using a temperature-dependent description of chlorophyll-specific        photosynthetic efficiency. For the VGPM, net primary production is a function of chlorophyll, available light, and the photosynthetic efficiency. The only difference between the Standard VGPM and the Eppley-VGPM is the temperature-dependent description of photosynthetic efficiencies, with the Eppley approach using an exponential function to account for variation in photosynthetic efficiencies due to photoacclimation. The similarity between these models (VGPM vs E_VGPM) is described more extensively in a paper by Elena-Carr et al (2006.). VGPM is a Depth Integrated Model(DIM) described by Behrenfeld and Falkowski (1997), with modification due to Eppley (1972) as implemented by Antoine and Morel (1996).\n\nThere are multiple retrieval algorithms for estimating Chl-a. These data (eppley_npp_chl_gsm) use the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM) method implemented in the SeaDAS processing software l2gen and described in “Chapter 11, and references therein, of IOCCG Report 5, 2006, (http://ioccg.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ioccg-report-05.pdf). This product is recommended for use in the VGPM model. The product Eppley_NPP_chl_gsm is experimental, in the sense that it is challenging to validate due to the scarcity of insitu measurments. It should only be used with caution informed by understanding of the algorithms.\n\nProduction of contemporary MODIS data ceased at 2024/12/26. Users requiring similar Ocean Colour Radiometry data beyond 2024 should consider the VIIRS instruments on the SNPP and NOAA20+ series of satellites, also provided by IMOS.",

The data are presented as a sequence of granules, each with a maximum size corresponding to 5 minutes of data, and beginning on UTC-5 minute boundary (eg. 04:05, 04:10, 04:15). The granules have been remapped from satellite projection into a geographic (Latitude/Longitude axes) projection and are formatted as CF-compliant netCDF files. It should be noted that the data are not processed until the definitive spacecraft ephemeris becomes available, usually 12-24 hours after the overpass. This means that the geolocation should be of a uniformly high standard.\\n\\nThere are multiple retrieval algorithms for estimating Chl-a. These data use the OC3 method recommended by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group and implemented in the SeaDAS processing software l2gen. The radiometric sensitivity of the MODIS sensor is evolving continuously during its mission and is being monitored regularly. The SeaDAS software uses tables of calibration coefficients that are updated periodically. From time to time upgrades to the algorithms and thand/or the format of the calibration tables are required, in which case a new version of SeaDAS is released. These data are initially being produced using SeaDAS 6.1, then SeaDAS 6.4 and eventually with SeaDAS 7.x. The data processed with each different version can be distinguished by the digits at the end of the root URL for the data; for example l2oc.nrt.61 is level-2 ocean colour (l2oc), using the near real time (nrt) data stream, produced using SeaDAS 6.1.\"}"

(2009, RSE, 113, pp2424-2430, doi:10.1016/j.rse.2009.07.016) applied a clustering technique to spectra to identify 8 sets of discrete optical water types for data from the MODIS sensor. This product \\\"owtd_csiro\\\" is produced using a CSIRO implementation of the Moore et al. algorithm, and testing shows that it closely reproduces the results of the original Moore et al implementation in the NASA SeaDAS package. The CSIRO implementation was created because the implementation in SeaDAS has not been kept up to date, and to extend the product to the VIIRS sensor.\"}"

These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), most typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water. An empirical relationship is then used to compute an estimate of the relative abundance of three phytoplankton size classes (micro, nano and picoplankton). \\n\\nThe methods used to decompose chl_oc3 are described by Brewin et al in two papers in 2010 and 2012. The two methods, denoted Brewin2010at and Brewin2012in, used calibration data from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans respectively. Users should note that these are unvalidated experimental products and they should familiarise themselves with the underlying algorithms and methodologies described in the published literature before making use of them.\\n\\nThe data are produced from the same data stream as the MODIS Chla_oci data set (https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au:443/geonetwork/srv/api/records/d7a14921-8f3f-4522-9a54-e7d1df969c8a). \\n \\nData are provided as two files per day, one with the percentage of nanoplankton, and one for picoplankton.

It is defined as the scaling length of the exponential decrease of the downwelling irradiance, and has units (m^-1). The VIIRS K490 product estimates Kd at 490nm wavelength, using a semi-empirical model based on the ratio of water leaving radiances at 490nm and 555nm.

This is not a GHRSST-quality product, and demanding applications requiring a high standard of accuracy should consider using one of the IMOS GHRSST products in preference. The MODIS SST is nevertheless useful primarily because it is measured at the same time as the water leaving radiances used to derive the optical properties (eg chl). This means it is both contemporaneous, and has a matching cloud mask, so it is valuable for applications that seek to combine both SST and optical properties (ie Net Primary Productivity variants). The data set provided here matches the Chl_oci product in temporal and spatial extent.\\n\\nThis SRS dataset covers waters around Australia.\\n\\nProduction of contemporary MODIS data ceased at 2024/12/26.
