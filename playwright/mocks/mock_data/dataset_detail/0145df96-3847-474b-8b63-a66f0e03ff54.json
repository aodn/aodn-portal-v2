They exist in one of the most extreme marine environments globally, characterised by the highest tidal range in the southern hemisphere, persistent turbidity, and frequent cyclones. These conditions have shaped coral reefs with distinct geomorphological attributes. The region’s remoteness has minimised direct anthropogenic pressures, but it also presents substantial logistical and financial challenges for data collection and fieldwork.\\n\\nTo improve access to information about this region, a geodatabase termed 'ReefKIM' was developed. ReefKIM integrates diverse datasets into a single, comprehensive repository to support research and management. Sources include satellite imagery, orthophotos, bathymetric charts, sub-bottom profiles, geological maps, seabed geomorphology, reef cores, biophysical data, and extensive ground-truthing.\\n\\nThis enabled consistent derivation of six broad feature classes:\\n(1) reef extents\\n(2) geomorphological zones\\n(3) habitats and substrates\\n(4) coastlines\\n(5) island boundaries; and\\n(6) other studies and work (e.g. ground truth points, survey, sample collections, coring sites, sub-bottom profiles, images)\\n\\nThis record provides access to items (1), (2) and (3) of the ReefKIM components, collated for the purposes of the Seamap Australia National Benthic Habitat Mapping collaborative project.\\n\\n• Reef extents: 853 reef features with size, shape, and reef type attributes.\\n• Geomorphological zones: Five standardised reef zones (land, reef flat, lagoon, reef crest, and fore-reef slope) mapped for 30 reefs.\\n• Habitats and substrates: Seven habitat/substrate classes (mangroves, sand, seagrass and algae, coral rubble, reef pavement with algal turf, crustose coralline algae, and coral communities) mapped for 30 islands and reefs.\\n\\nAdditional ReefKIM products are stored at the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre under:\\nWA Node Ocean Data Network > WAMSI2 > KMRP > 1.3 > 1.3.1\\nA full directory is documented in '1.3.1_Folder_Structure.pdf' in 1.3.1>001_Metadata at https://storage.pawsey.org.au/public/projects\"}"

From 21 to 24 July 2021, 109 km² of the Norfolk Shelf was mapped using high-resolution multibeam sonar, along with two sub-bottom profiles. These were supplemented by 44 Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) deployments in the northeast and south of the island to assess fish assemblages and provide ground truthing data for interpretation of seabed nature.\\n\\nIn November 2021, a separate coastal survey using high-resolution drone photogrammetry captured geomorphic and habitat information at seven coastal sites: Captain Cook Lookout, Anson Bay, Puppy’s Point, Headstone Point, Slaughter Bay and Bombora Beach, and Cemetery and Emily Bay. These locations span a variety of morphologies, from exposed basaltic shore platforms and dramatic cliffs to offshore stacks and pockets of rocky beach.\\n\\nThe data collected by the project provides a detailed view of the marine and coastal geomorphology of Norfolk Island. The data provides an initial condition assessment of key areas to inform park management, habitat protection, and future targeted studies such as further bathymetric mapping in sensitive areas and expanded ground-truthing of seabed habitats.\"}"

They support the life history stages of a diverse suite of tropical species including commercially harvested ones. In addition to natural disturbance regimes, habitats are altered in response to the sectoral uses, which in turn affects the distribution and life histories of species. Habitats thus serve as the nexus linking species with uses and natural disturbance, and different habitats serve different purposes at various stages of the life history of a species. A detailed understanding of habitats, at least at the structural level, is thus a prerequisite for a more comprehensive understanding of ecological structure and functions on the North West Shelf.\\n\\nThis component of the North West Shelf Joint Environmental Management Study (NWSJEMS) aimed to collate and integrate data on habitats for the region of the North West Shelf extending from North West Cape to Port Hedland and from the coast to the 200 m isobath. The three main activities of the study were: Development of an integrated collection of information on habitats of the North West Shelf, including expert information; Application of the CSIRO Habitat Classification Framework to the data to determine the spatial nesting and structuring of habitat units on the North West Shelf; and Provision of the habitat structure classification for input into other models developed within NWSJEMS.\\n\\nThis record describes data of key benthic marine ecosystems and habitats.

The occurrences of benthic habitat type were derived through machine learning applied to geolocated photos of the benthos (>100,000 photos) that were collected along reef flats and reef slopes at various offshore shallow reefs (~100 reefs). The modelling process involves taking those occurrences of benthic habitat at known locations (training data) and using a machine learning model to build a relationship between benthic habitat type and the underlying data layers (imagery, depth, slope, waves). Because the data layers cover the whole Great Barrier Reef, a prediction is then able to be made for benthic habitat across the whole Great Barrier Reef as well. Contextual editing was then used to make changes to the map, based on a set of geomorphology- and ecology-based rules, such as what environment a class can occur in and what classes are able to neighbour each other (object-based rulesets). This map covers the “offshore” or “mid and outer-shelf” reefs of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Some of the occurrences of benthic habitat type are withheld from the process, and used to check how well the mapping performed at the end (validation). The mapping was carried out by the Remote Sensing Research Centre at the University of Queensland.\\n\\nThe scientific method for generating the benthic habitat map can be briefly described as:\\n1. Ingestion of Sentinel-2 satellite image data, bathymetry and wave climate data derived from Sentinel-2 image data, and various additional derived environmental covariates into Google Earth Engine\\n2. Stacking of the input data sources into a model-ready environment\\n3. Running a segmentation routine to create image objects\\n4. Fitting a supervised machine learning model (e.g. random forest) to known occurrences in order to classify segments into benthic classes\\n5. Application of object based rules using a range of colour, shape texture and relationship rules to modify the class attribution\\n6.

It contains five large, shallow reef systems (less than 15 m deep) ranging in size from 227 sq. km (Ashmore Reef) to 4.5 sq. km (Browse Island). They total approximately 560 sq. km in area. Immediately north of the MOU74 Box within the Australian Fishing Zone (Little Area A) is another shallow reef, Hibernia Reef. In addition to the shallow reefs, there is approximately 925 sq. km of shoal areas (15 to 50 m deep) within the MOU74 Box and 301 sq. km of shoal areas in Little Area A. \\nThe reefs and shoals support populations of sedentary reef resources including several species of holothurians (beche-de-mer, sea cucumbers) and trochus, as well as reef-associated fin-fish and sharks. These resources have been fished for many years by Indonesian fishers. Ashmore Reef was declared a Marine Nature Reserve in 1983, banning the removal of fauna and flora to a depth of 50 m. The remaining reefs in the area are under continued, and probably increasing, fishing pressure. \\nThe marine resources of the MOU74 Box are managed by the Australian Government. Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Australian and Indonesian governments, continued traditional fishing by Indonesian fishing vessels is allowed, principally for sedentary resources such as beche-de-mer (trepang) and trochus, but also fin-fish and reef shark. Apart from limited catch data collected by surveillance and regulatory authorities, little is known about the catch of the Indonesian fishers and the effects of fishing on the target species. There are concerns that the current level of fishing may be unsustainable.\\nIn September and October 1998, CSIRO Division of Marine Resources surveyed the shallow reefs (0-15 m deep) and shoal areas (15-50 m deep) of the MOU74 Box area and Little Area A to the north. Its purpose was to assess the status of the reef resources in the area, and the environment that supports them. Fieldwork for the survey was completed on 10 October 1998. \\nOverall, the sedentary marine living resources on the shallow reefs were heavily depleted with the high-value species over-exploited and the lower value species probably either fully or over-exploited. Despite the low density, there appears to be a sustained fishing effort by Indonesian fishers in the area. A drastic reduction in effort would be required to allow for a recovery of the higher value species, and to protect other species from severe depletion. \\nThe exception is Ashmore Reef, where there were significant populations of most target species. However, there is most likely some illegal fishing occurring on Ashmore Reef and there is clear evidence of exploitation of at least the high-value resources. The nature of these fisheries and the depleted state of the other reefs in the MOU74 Box suggests that the remaining resources on Ashmore Reef could be quickly depleted if the protection currently given to the reef is not maintained and possibly enhanced. For many reasons, including the potential for recruitment of larvae to depleted reefs, it is important that these populations are protected. Year round protection of the resources on Ashmore Reef should be considered.\\n\\nThis record describes the following survey data for the Timor MOU74 Box:\\n• Classified satellite habitat map for Scott and Seringapatam Reefs.\\n• Classified satellite habitat map for Ashmore, Hibernia and Cartier Reefs.\"}"

This image was acquired 9:40 am, on the 27th July 2011 (5.14 am low tide at Brisbane Bar). The image classification was applied on areas of clear waters up to three metres depth and for exposed regions of Moreton Bay. Field validation data was collected at 4797 survey sites by UQ. GPS referenced field data were used as training areas for the image classification process. For this training the substrate DN signatures were extracted from the Landsat 5 TM image for field survey locations of known substrate cover, enabling a characteristic \\\"spectral reflectance signature\\\" to be defined for each target. The Landsat TM image, containing only those pixels in water < 3.0m deep, was then subject to minimum distance to means algorithm to group pixels with similar DN signatures (assumed to correspond to the different substrata). This process enabled each pixel to be assigned a label of either seagrass cover (0, 1-25 %, 25-50 %, 50-75 % and 75-100 %). The resulting raster data was then converted into a vector polygon file. Species information was added based on the field data and expert knowledge. Both polygon files were joined by overlaying features of remote sensing files with the EHMP field data to produce an output theme that contains the attributes and full extent of both themes. If polygons of remote sensing were within polygons of field data the assumption was made that the remote sensing polygon was showing more detail and the underlying field polygon was deleted.\"}"

This research is a collaboration between Geoscience Australia (GA), the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), the Department of Land Resource Management (DLRM) and the Darwin Port Corporation. Key objectives are to:\\n- Produce detailed maps of the bathymetry and derived parameters such as slope and rugosity,\\n- Classify the seabed into areas of hard and soft substrate, and,\\n- Produce seabed habitat maps (or seascapes).\\n\\nKey outcomes from the surveys include:\\n1. Improved understanding of the seabed of Darwin Harbour. The main seabed geomorphic features identified in Darwin Harbour include banks, ridges, plains and scarps, and a deep central channel that divides into smaller and shallower channels. Acoustically hard substrates are found mostly on banks and are associated with rocky reef and sponge gardens, and are often overlain by a thin veneer of sandy sediment. In contrast, plains and channels are characterised by acoustically soft substrates and are associated with fine sediments (mud and sand).\\n2. Classification of physical seabed properties to produce a Seascape Map for Darwin Harbour. Six seascape classes (potential habitats) were derived using an Iterative Self Organising (ISO) unsupervised classification scheme. These six classes are related to statistically unique combinations of seabed substrate, relief, bedform and presence of sediment veneer (quite often inferred from presence of epibenthic biota).\"}"

The objective of this work is to assess the accuracy and relevance of the process used to derive geomorphic zone and benthic community zone maps for three western Pacific coral reefs produced from multi-scale, object-based image analysis (OBIA) of high-spatial-resolution multi-spectral images, guided by field survey data. Three Quickbird-2 multi-spectral data sets from reefs in Australia, Palau and Fiji and georeferenced field photographs were used in a multi-scale segmentation and object-based image classification to map geomorphic zones and benthic community zones. A per-pixel approach was also tested for mapping benthic community zones. Validation of the maps and comparison to past approaches indicated the multi-scale OBIA process enabled field data, operator field experience and a conceptual hierarchical model of the coral reef environment to be linked to provide output maps at geomorphic zone and benthic community scales on coral reefs. The OBIA mapping accuracies were comparable with previously published work using other methods; however, the classes mapped were matched to a predetermined set of features on the reef.\"}"

This rapidly expanding coastal population has increased the frequency and intensity of both commercial and recreational activities around Point Lookout dive sites (EPA 2008).\\n\\nHabitats were mapped using a combination of towed GPS photo transects, aerial photography and expert knowledge. This data provides georeferenced information regarding the major features of each of the Point Lookout Dive Sites.\"}"

      "title": "{\"title\":\"Jurien Bay benthic habitat mapping\",\"recordAbstract\":\"Jurien Bay Boat Harbour is located north of the town of Jurien Bay, ~250 km north of Perth, Western Australia. The Boat Harbour services a range of government, recreational and commercial vessels and is managed by the WA Department of Transport (DoT).\\n\\nWrack and marine sediments frequently accumulate in the Boat Harbour, negatively affecting the navigability, environment and aesthetic quality of the Harbour. To manage these impacts, routine maintenance dredging is undertaken by DoT.\\n\\nTo inform future dredging requirements and marine environmental management of the Boat Harbour, BMT undertook benthic habitat mapping of Jurien Bay in November 2017 on behalf of DoT. The objectives of the mapping project were to:\\ni. collect baseline data on the spatial extent and characteristics of benthic habitats in the mapping area, and\\nii. qualitatively characterise the extent of benthic primary producer habitat surrounding the Boat Harbour, and develop a mapping product to inform dredging operations and potential future environmental approvals applications, if necessary.\\n\\nMapping was conducted by first collating satellite imagery to identify benthic habitat features to be ground-truthed by towed video. Video footage was annotated with biological attributes and combined with the satellite imagery to create classified benthic habitat maps of an area offshore of the Boat Harbour.\\n\\nSee the \\\"Lineage\\\" section of this record and attached survey report for detailed methodology.\"}"

Solander in collaboration with Geoscience Australia, the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), University of Western Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory between 12 September - 5 October, 2012. This dataset comprises an interpreted geomorphic map.\\n\\nInterpreted local-scale geomorphic maps were produced for each survey area in the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) using multibeam bathymetry and backscatter grids at 2 m resolution and bathymetric derivatives (e.g. slope; 1-m contours). Six geomorphic units; bank, depression, mound, plain, scarp and terrace were identified and mapped using definitions suitable for interpretation at the local scale (nominally 1:10 000). Maps and polygons were manual digitised in ArcGIS using the spatial analyst and 3D analyst toolboxes.\\n\\nFor further information on the geomorphic mapping methods please refer to Appendix N of the post-survey report, published as Geoscience Australia Record 2013/38: Nichol, S.L., Howard, F.J.F., Kool, J., Stowar, M., Bouchet, P., Radke, L., Siwabessy, J., Przeslawski, R., Picard, K., Alvarez de Glasby, B., Colquhoun, J., Letessier, T. & Heyward, A. 2013.

The capability to map seagrass meadows in waters of varying clarity using a consistent and repeatable method is an invaluable resource for conservation and management of seagrass regionally and globally. The map was created using an adaptation of a Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud processing and machine learning algorithm which for seagrass, utilized citizen science spot check field data, Landsat 8 OLI imagery pulled directly from GEE, a bathymetry layer (30 m), slope derived from depth and a coral mask. This dataset consists of a shapefile that shows seagrass presence (≥ 25 % cover) and substrate mapped simultaneously for the turbid waters of the Western Bay coastline and the optically clear waters of the Eastern Banks, Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia.\\n\\nThis record contains a snapshot of the data taken for use in Seamap Australia (a national benthic habitat map; https://seamapaustralia.org).
