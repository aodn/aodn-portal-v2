      "description": "In the last 30 years, more than 2,000 research papers have been published on the impact of temperature stress on coral reef organisms. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to objectively examine what is known about the potential for natural adaptation of corals to increased temperatures and the effect sizes of assisted evolution efforts that have been documented to date. To identify relevant studies, we conducted a literature search (October 27, 2022) using the ISI Web Of Science database and search engine with the following strings to identify relevant peer-reviewed publications: Title = coral, Topic = bleach AND adapt, heat AND adapt, temperature AND adapt*, acclimat* AND adapt*, acclimat* AND bleach, acclimat* AND temperature, temperature AND bleach, assisted AND evolution, assist AND gene AND flow, assisted AND migration, gene AND edit, selective AND breed.\n\nThe initial search returned 2,397 papers that met the above criteria. These papers were examined to assess if the study included the following elements:\n\n(1) a heat stress condition under laboratory or field conditions,\n\n(2) samples from any life history stage of a coral holobiont (excluding host-tissue extractions that were cultured in the lab, separated from the exoskeleton, or papers based solely on cultures of isolated symbionts or microbes and ignoring the coral holobiont), and\n\n(3) data reported for at least one coral species in the order Scleractinia from a tropical environment.\n\nIn the end, 562 publications included all three elements. In some instances, multiple publications were found to report different aspects of the same heat stress experiment, but these were treated as independent experiments given that there was no duplication of data.\n\n\nIncluded in this collection is the R code for mapping products presented in the publication, which built on the source dataset Marine Ecoregions Of the World (MEOW).",

      "title": "IMOS Bio-Acoustic Ships of Opportunity (BA SOOP) Sub-Facility",
      "description": "The IMOS Bio-Acoustic Ship Of Opportunity (BA-SOOP) sub-facility is part of a major international effort that aims to determine the distribution and abundance of mid-trophic level organisms (meso-zooplanktonic and micro-nektonic) preyed by top predators (sharks, tuna) by using commercial fishing vessels (SOOP), research vessels, automated oceanic moorings, acoustic recorders, drifters and gliders.  The MAAS (Mid-trophic Automatic Acoustic Sampler) project targets two levels of technology: a high level suited to large platforms such as fixed moorings, vessels or AUV and low level platforms adapted to a large number of autonomous drifters.\n\nBA-SOOP commenced on the 1st of July 2010 to collect underway acoustic data from commercial fishing and research vessels. At present, nine vessels are participating in the BA-SOOP program. Six are commercial fishing vessels that have agreed to record data during transits to and from fishing grounds. The remaining three are scientific research vessels collecting underway acoustic data during transits and science operations. \n\nBio acoustic signals measure the distribution of mid-water prey species (micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish.  Micronekton form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds. The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. The mapping complements established observing systems such as physical sampling of ocean currents, surveys of ocean chemistry and biology (plankton and zooplankton), and electronic tagging and tracking of large marine fish and mammals. The combined information greatly enhances the capacity of marine scientists to monitor shifts in food availability over time, assisting in the near real-time monitoring and modelling of oceanography, ecosystems, fisheries and climate change, and in understanding the behaviour of top predators.\n\nA full metadata record is also stored in each netCDF file. The document SOOP-BA NetCDF manual v1.0.doc describes the netCDF format and metadata fields that have been defined.",

      "description": "The CSIRO archive of the Tas Futures 2008 Regional Climate Model simulation datasets for the years 1961-2100. Created with the CSIRO CCAM (Cubic Conformal Amostpheric Model) RCM (Regional Climate Model) by dynamically downscaling the GFDL CM2.0 (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Global Climate Model 2.0) outputs to 60 km resolution (C64 Grid) with the main target area centered over Australasia. These runs have been completed using only bias corrected SST(Sea Surface Temperatures) and Sea Ice (No Atmospheric) forcings. 4X Daily atmospheric variables are available globally at 18 levels with .5º (60km) resolution on a C64 Grid. There are 1680 daily files in netcdf format, totaling approximately 2.47 TB. Regional climate data is also available for CCAM nested in other GCMS as part of this project. This dataset has also been further downscaled to 14km resolution for the Tasmania region.",

      "description": "The Data Trawler is a Java application that has been developed under the auspices of the North West Shelf Joint Environmental Management Project (NWS JEMS) and the CMAR Data Centre. This application provides on-line access to the data in the Data Warehouse, an Oracle data repository. See MarLIN record 6390 for details of the Warehouse. The Trawler's primary functions are to allow users to: Discover - Discover data of interest using geographic, temporal and data category search criteria. Investigate - View a brief summary of any data sets returned which meet the search criteria and display their spatial distribution. Download - Place desired datasets into a data 'shopping basket' and then download them to your local computer. To get the full benefit out of using the application a user is required to provide an email address (a logon) and a password. If you are not a CMR staff member or other authorised user you will be allowed access to the Warehouse as a ''Public User''. Public users have only limited access to Warehouse content. See the Data Link to access the CMR Data Trawler.",
