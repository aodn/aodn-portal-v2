      "description": "The Australian National Mooring Network (ANMN) Facility is a series of national reference stations and regional moorings designed to monitor particular oceanographic phenomena in Australian coastal ocean waters. This collection contains time-series observations of temperature and salinity from moorings deployed by the ANMN. The primary parameters are temperature, pressure (when available) and depth of the instrument. A subset of this collection also includes conductivity and salinity. The observations were made using a range of temperature loggers, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instruments, and temperature sensors on acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). We are also producing a gridded product of temperature time-series profiles based on these data. These will be available in a separate collection.",

The East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200m or more. \\n\\nManagement of this mooring is undertaken by staff from the National Reference Station (North Stradbroke and Maria Island).\"}"

Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the Australian National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80 deg C)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future.

Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifing certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. Additional information for this dataset may be available via the original MarLIN metadata entry: https://marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c13451a9-7cfe-091c-e044-00144f7bc0f4. For information on using the data please refer to Eriksen et al. 2019. It is advised that anyone using this data should read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The data are made available in binned products for ease of use. As taxonomy changes over time and the ability of analysts improves with training more and more species are able to be identified over time. The products account for these changes and for real absences from the samples. A 0 abundance means that the species was looked for and not seen, -999 means that the species was not looked for in that sample. The products are therefore applicable for use in time series analysis. There are 5 products to choose from: Raw product (includes all data); Copepod species file (includes all copepod data where species have been identified); Non copepod species file (includes all non copepod data where species have been identified); Genus product (includes all data binned to genus level); Higher taxonomic group (includes all data binned to functional groups). The binned and pivoted products described are currently only available by contacting imos-plankton@csiro.au. A project to make these products available directly via the portal is under way.

Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the Australian National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifing certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. Additional information for this dataset may be available via the original MarLIN metadata entry: https://marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c13451a9-7cfe-091c-e044-00144f7bc0f4. For information on using the data please refer to Eriksen et al. 2019. It is advised that anyone using this data should read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The data are made available in binned products for ease of use. As taxonomy changes over time and the ability of analysts improves with training more and more species are able to be identified over time. The products account for these changes and for real absences from the samples. A 0 abundance means that the species was looked for and not seen, -999 means that the species was not looked for in that sample. The products are therefore applicable for use in time series analysis. There are 5 products to choose from: Raw product (includes all data); Copepod species file (includes all copepod data where species have been identified); Non copepod species file (includes all non copepod data where species have been identified); Genus product (includes all data binned to genus level); Higher taxonomic group (includes all data binned to functional groups). The binned and pivoted products described are currently only available by contacting imos-plankton@csiro.au. A project to make these products available directly via the portal is under way. This collection currently only provides direct access to the raw data in \\\"flat table\\\" form (separate row for each taxon in each sample). **This dataset has been superseded by the \\\"IMOS - Zooplankton Abundance and Biomass (reference stations)\\\" collection that is available at https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/api/records/bc14672f-c007-408e-972b-684d8415dae8 (this collection was removed from the AODN Portal in December 2021).**\"}"

This information sheds light on larval distribution and spawning for fisheries management needs. This dataset includes larval fish abundances collected from 12 voyages around Australia since 1983, as well as more recent data from the Marine National Facility (MNF). The backbone of the dataset is from five Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Reference Stations (NRS) (North Stradbroke, Port Hacking, Maria Island, Kangaroo Island and Rottnest Island), between 2014 and 2021 as part of the IMOS Larval Fish Monitoring Sub-Facility of the National Mooring Network Facility (data currently available up to 2021). This adds information to the biological, ecological and oceanic measurements already sampled at these long-term monitoring sites. For information on using the data from the NRS stations and research voyages, please refer to Smith et al., 2018. It is advised that anyone using this data should read this methodology or contact the project contact person to understand the nuances of each sampling and analysis chain.\\n\\nThe fish larvae product is available as raw count product, where fish larvae are classified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (with 228 taxonomic groups identified so far, at either the Family, Genus, or Species level). Associated metadata includes location, temperature, salinity, net type, and tow volume.\\n\\nThere is a static snapshot of the database as at March 2018 (https://dx.doi.org/10.4225/69/5ab33c62f9c52), and this has been documented in a Scientific Data publication (Smith et al., 2018). This metadata record provides access to the dynamic (most recent) version of the database, which can serve as a data repository for survey of larval fish assemblages in the region.\"}"

The mooring arrays provide near real time and delayed mode observations from oceanographic moorings comprising physical (temperature, salinity, sea level and currents) and on most moorings, water quality measurements (turbidity, fluorescence, dissolved oxygen). \\n\\nThe GBR array (extends an earlier long term observing program) is located along the outer Great Barrier Reef in order to monitor the Western Boundary currents of the Coral Sea comprising the poleward East Australian Current (EAC) and the equator-ward Gulf of Papua Current. Four mooring pairs consist of a continental slope mooring in 70 to 300m of water and its partner on the outer continental shelf within the reef matrix in depths of 30 to 70m. The array is designed to detect any changes in circulation, temperature response, mixed layer depth and ocean-shelf exchanges. \\n\\nWAIMOS observations in the north west of Australia commenced in June 2010 with the roll out of 4 moorings from Joseph Bonaparte Gulf to the Timor slope. These continental shelf moorings complement a deep water array monitoring the Indonesian Throughflow in the Timor Tough and Ombai Strait operated by the Deep Water Moorings Facility (formerly known as the Australian Bluewater Observing System). This array was decommissioned in 2019, and equipment was moved to a new array on the North West Shelf. In early 2012 two more arrays were added off the Kimberley and Pilbara continental shelf regions (these were discontinued in August 2014). The arrays are looking to monitor boundary currents such as the Holloway and Leeuwin Currents. Cross-shelf exchanges are also observed in these high energy macro-tidal and internal wave dominated shelves. \\n\\nIn 2013 in partnership with the Darwin Port Corp, the Northern Territory Government a new real time mooring was located in Beagle Gulf (this mooring was decommissioned in July 2017). The Palm Passage mooring on the GBR was upgraded to near-real-time in February 2013.\"}"

It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200m or more. \\n\\nManagement of this mooring is undertaken by staff from the National Reference Station (North Stradbroke and Maria Island).\"}"

      "description": "This dataset comprises the zooplankton abundance estimates analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network - National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the Australian National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifing certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. Additional information for this dataset may be available via the original MarLIN metadata entry: https://marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c13451a9-7cfe-091c-e044-00144f7bc0f4. For information on using the data please refer to Eriksen et al. 2019. It is advised that anyone using this data should read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The data are made available in binned products for ease of use. As taxonomy changes over time and the ability of analysts improves with training more and more species are able to be identified over time. The products account for these changes and for real absences from the samples. A 0 abundance means that the species was looked for and not seen, -999 means that the species was not looked for in that sample. The products are therefore applicable for use in time series analysis. There are 5 products to choose from: Raw product (includes all data); Copepod species file (includes all copepod data where species have been identified); Non copepod species file (includes all non copepod data where species have been identified); Genus product (includes all data binned to genus level); Higher taxonomic group (includes all data binned to functional groups). The binned and pivoted products described are currently only available by contacting imos-plankton@csiro.au. A project to make these products available directly via the portal is under way. This collection currently only provides direct access to the raw data in \"flat table\" form (separate row for each taxon in each sample). **This dataset has been superseded by the \"IMOS - Zooplankton Abundance and Biomass (reference stations)\" collection that is available at https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/api/records/bc14672f-c007-408e-972b-684d8415dae8 (this collection was removed from the AODN Portal in December 2021).**",

Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the Australian National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80 deg C)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure.

      "description": "This record describes the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data collected from the Marine National Facility RV Investigator voyage IN2023_V01, titled: \"Antarctic Bottom Water production in the past: Records from marine sediments, Cape Darnley, East Antarctica.\" The voyage took place between January 25, 2023 and March 2, 2023 (AEST), departing from Fremantle and returning to Hobart.\n\nThis voyage had two main scientific objectives. First, to understand past changes in Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) production using long sediment cores from the continental slope over multiple warm periods during the Pleistocene. Second, to develop an improved bathymetry model to support oceanographic modelling of AABW pathways. Sediment core records of previous warmer interglacial will provide an analogue for understanding the impact of any future changes in bottom water production associated with a warming climate.\nThis report describes the production of quality-controlled ADCP data from RV Investigator voyage IN2023_V01.\nThe OS150 unit was run for the majority part of the voyage whilst the OS75 was run for parts of  the voyage.\nThe OS75 showed unusual behaviour where the data depth was half the expected value at around 350m with low data quality. On-board investigation discovered that beams 1 and 2 of the OS75 unit were severely degraded and the fault was attributed to the likely failure of the ceramic arrays.\nADCP data were collected using the University of Hawaii Data Acquisition System (UHDAS) and post-processed using the Common Ocean Data Access System (CODAS). Documentation for these systems can be found in (Hummon, 2009-2021).\nBoth the RDI Ocean Surveyor 150kHz ADCP and the RDI Ocean Surveyor 75kHz ADCP were run in narrowband mode.\nInternal triggering was used.\nThe drop keel (port) extension was set at below the waterline as detailed:\n2m from the voyage start until 11-Feb-2023 09:20:05 UTC,\n0m (Zero) from 11-Feb-2023 09:21:30 to 21-Feb-2023 23:24:15 UTC and\n2m from 21-Feb-2023 23:25:05UTC to the end of the voyage.\nThere were several gaps in the OS75 ADCP data due to the investigation on board related to the fault discussed above and the reduction in the usual data quality resulted in extra processing effort being required. Apart from the usual data cleaning, there were no significant ADCP processing-related issues in relation to the OS150 data.\nTo access the full voyage plan and other reports and data associated with this voyage, please see the contact information at the end of this report.\n\nThis dataset was processed (quality-controlled), and then archived by the CSIRO National Collections and Marine Infrastructure (NCMI) Information and Data Centre (IDC).",
