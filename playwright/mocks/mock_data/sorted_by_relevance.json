For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\\n\\n--------------------\\n\\nEffective management of marine assets requires an understanding of ecosystems and the processes that influence patterns of biodiversity. Focusing on the North and North-west regions, this project will leverage previous research to improve ecosystem understanding through a synthesis of existing information and by making testable predictions about the character and extent of conservation values, including for key ecological features (KEFs) and Commonwealth Marine Reserves. End-users and stakeholders will benefit from improved regional descriptions of marine ecosystems and uncertainty statements. In turn, this will inform prioritisation of future investments in monitoring marine ecosystems and State of the Environment reporting. \\n\\nPlanned Outputs\\n• A report on the synthesis (based on collations completed in 2015) of datasets and models for the North and NW identifying areas of greatest information coverage, gaps and themed to CMRs and KEFs in those regions. This report will also describe key spatial patterns in biodiversity (benthic and pelagic) and associations between benthic environments, fish and megafauna and large scale processes (e.g. oceanography).\\n• Predictions and related products (maps) of the spatial distribution of biodiversity across the Oceanic Shoals CMR that encompasses benthic habitat, pelagic and demersal fish and megafauna communities. This will provide an example/test case at the National Prioritisation Workshop of how confidently predictive modelling can be used to describe assets and values in data poor areas to inform management and monitoring. \\n• An updated conceptual model of ecosystem processes (benthic and pelagic) within the Oceanic Shoals CMR based on extension of modelling into pelagics.\\n• A review of existing knowledge of the Ancient Coastline KEF.\\n• A qualitative model of Glomar Shoal KEF (to be confirmed in consultation with DOE).\\n• Communication products that capture activities and general interest stories of scientific results disseminated through NW Atlas social media links.\\n• Upload of new relevant spatial data layers in NW Atlas for management and planning, and engagement with end users to maximize uptake of the NW Atlas products.\"}"

The park is situated about halfway along the Lord Howe Rise seamount chain on the western flank of the Lord Howe Rise. Seamounts along this chain formed from Miocene volcanism via a migrating magma source (“hotspot”) after the opening of the Tasman Sea. Two large, flat-topped volcanic seamounts dominate the park. Their gently sloping summits have accumulated veneers of sediment, which in places have formed fields of bedforms. Steep cliffs, debris and large mass movement scars encircle each seamount, and contrast with the lower gradient abyssal plains from which they rise. Spanning over 3 km of ocean depths, the seamounts are likely to serve multiple and important roles as breeding locations, resting areas, navigational landmarks or supplementary feeding grounds for some cetaceans (e.g. humpback whales, sperm whales). They may also act as important aggregation points for other highly migratory pelagic species. The bathymetry shown here was collected on two surveys - the first in 2007 by Geoscience Australia and the second in 2017 by Geoscience Australia in collaboration with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology. The Gifford Marine Park has also been the focus of a study undertaken by the Marine Biodiversity Hub as part of the National Environmental Science Program.\\nThis research is supported by the National Environmental Science Program (NESP) Marine Biodiversity Hub through Project D1.\"}"

      "title": "North Marine Region demersal fish and invertebrate collection records (DEW collation)",
      "description": "The dataset comprises catch records of demersal fish and invertebrates from demersal fish trawls, demersal prawn trawls and epibenthic sled samples from the Northern Planning Region. It is a compilation of data from 9 research voyages (SO 05/80, SO 07/80, SO 02/81, SS 03/90, SS 05/91, SS 01/93, SS 02/97, SS 08/97and SS 03/98). The catch of each species in a sample is recorded as raw weight and count, gross weight and count (raw values divided by the subsampling fraction) and per area weight and count. Species are recorded as CAAB codes. Sample attributes include the voyage, location, time, sampling gear and sampled area. The dataset was created for the Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEW) for use in profiling of the North Marine Region during the development of a marine bioregional plan for the region. Data from all voyages are in a single set of tables and in the same structure and measurement units. The aim of the dataset is to provide convenient access to the data from the source datasets, which were stored in various data structures in various locations. Although the data are presented in uniform measurement units of counts and weights per unit area, data from different samples cannot be assumed to be comparable. In particular, the catchability of a species varies among types of sampling gears. Even samples from a given gear type on a given voyage may not all be comparable to one another. For example, gear may be altered during a voyage (e.g. multiple codend mesh sizes may be tried) and fish trawls are occasionally aimed at fish visible on the echo sounder. The data should therefore be analysed no more than semi-quantitatively. Assumptions on the comparability of samples -- even from a single voyage and gear type -- should be based on reference to the voyage reports.",

      "description": "This record is an overview entry for biological data collected on Southern Surveyor cruise SS 08/95. This cruise took place in the North West Shelf during 18 August - 9 September 1995, under the leadership of Wade Whitelaw. Biological data collected on this cruise include demersal fish and invertebrate samples from 104 stations trawled and 35 mm camera photography of 33 stations trawled. Fish catches were identifed and weighed by species with up to 90 species being caught per half hour trawl. Greatest diversity occurred at the shallower stations. Length frequency data was collected for 14 species of fish (see taxonomy keywords), and otoliths were collected for 4 of the major species (L. sebae, L. choerorynchus, S. undosquamis and N. furcosus). Approximately 50 taxonomic voucher specimens and 100 other specimens were photographed and retained for the Handbook of Australian Seafood, and about 80 specimens and 400 muscle samples were kept for the fillet analysis study. Another 80-90 unidentified specimens were also retained, being mainly deep water species, mustelus species and samples of lizard fish. 6 'fish down' trawl experiments were completed and all fish identified, counted and weighed by species with 30 stomachs collected from Lethrinus genivittatus, L. choerorynchus, Memipterus furcosus and Saurida undosquamis. Video photography and 35 mm camera photography of the trawls were also obtained. 3 hydrographic transects were completed with the sumbersible data logger (SDL) and over 195 species of sponges for taxonomic studies by the Queensland Museum were collected. 125 humpback whales and 8 unidentified cetaceans and approximately 120 dophins were also observed during the cruise. Please note: This metadata record is a preliminary entry derived from information in the cruise plan and/or cruise report. Individual data types - which may span several cruises - will be indexed separately within this metadata system in due course. - Biological Field Data Sheets recorded during this voyage have been scanned to PDF, and are available (to CSIRO Staff) on-line.

The data was generated by Seamap Australia as part of an Our Marine Parks (Parks Australia) project with funding from the Australian Government to improve knowledge relating to classification of the Australian Marine Parks real estate.\n\nBathymetry data was collated from existing AusSeabed data holdings and compiled into multi-resolution bathymetry mosaics for each Park (see https://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/fb451be4-9de1-4bc2-8fd6-0f285f90916f). All publicly available bathymetry data as at 30th June 2022 was included. Macquarie Island was updated on 25/08/2023 to reflect the new AMP boundaries.\n\nThe Whitebox tools package in R was used to calculate geomorphometry using the geomorphron function. Processing for each Park was addressed manually, with search distances and slope thresholds adjusted between Parks depending on quality and resolution of bathymetry data, and characteristics of the seafloor. Geomorphons were classified into geomorphic features using the Dove et al (2020) Seabed Morphology Features Glossary. These geomorphic units provide a consistent way to classify the seabed and may be used in combination with visual validation methods to develop benthic habitat maps.\n\nData is supplied as a Web Map Service of geomorphic features overlaid on hillshade for the mapped regions. Data is available for download as a zipped package of geotiffs with accompanying hillshade.
