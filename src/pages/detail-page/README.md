# Name conventions for details on detail page.

Please name top level(e.g.: Abstract, About, Metadat Information ... ) "XXXpanel", (path: src/pages/detail-page/subpages/tab-panels)
Please name second level (e.g.: keywords, contacts, credits...) "XXXList", (path: src/components/list)

A list may not be a real list (show some similar things). It may only show one thing (such as metadata identifer). So please treat the name xxxList as a convention, to show the page structure:

A panel contains one or several lists;

A list contains one or several items;
