      "Statement: Data from AIMS weather stations are subjected to two quality control processes.\n\nThe first quality control process involves applying automatic rules to the raw data to flag data points that are unlikely to be correct. These rules flag:\n- Values frequently associated with sensors which are faulty, in need of a service or are not working properly.\n- Values outside believable ranges.\n- Values that are out of range compared to other nearby stations.\n\nThe second quality control process involves manual visualisation of all data. Data from all sensors are individually graphed and compared to sensors on the same station (e.g. water temperature 1 and water temperature 2), calibrated temperature loggers, predicted values (e.g. PAR) or compared to sensors from nearby stations (including Bureau of Meteorology stations in the case of barometric pressure, wind speed and direction).\n\nAfter these processes have been applied the data can be categorised in the following three levels.\n\nLevel 0: Raw unprocessed data as received from the AWS. This data has had no quality control process applied to it.\n\nLevel 1: Level 1 data has had all suspect data points removed but no suspect data points are corrected.\n\nLevel 2: Level 2 data has had all suspect data points that were removed in Level 1 corrected where possible.\n\nData from all three levels can be accessed from the AIMS weather station web site.\n\n\n \n\n\n IMOS Sensor Floats:\n\n\nAll sensors are factory calibrated and serviced every six months.\nData are checked against a set of rules and then flagged using the IODE set of flags.",

  description:
    'This dataset contains meteorological and sea temperature data from the weather station moored in the lagoon on Davies Reef on the Great Barrier Reef.\n These data are collected to support scientific research at AIMS. Data are made available on request to other researchers and to the public.\n The weather station is an AIMS Mk3 System.Data recorded: Sea Temperature (4m, 8.5m and 18.5m at MSL), Barometric Pressure, Air Temperature, Solar Radiation (PAR), Wind Direction True (vector averaged), Wind Speed True (30 min average).1. Operation and Weather SensorsThe weather stations collect and store data in electronic memory every half-hour. A central base station calls each remote station regularly using HF radio or telephone lines. The data is transmitted over the radio as a frequency shift keyed signal, organised as packets of information. Errors are detected using parity and check sum methods. Invalid packets are identified by the Base Station, which requests they be sent again. This concept allows recovery of a very high percentage of the data despite poor communications. Remote stations store data for 21 days. Features such as automatic operation, remote control, remote time setting, built in diagnostics, have been developed and incorporated.The sensors are a key part of a weather station. The following are chosen considering the cost, reliability and accuracy.* R.M.Young manufactures the wind sensor, a model number 05103. It is a propeller type with the advantages of being highly linear, highly interchangeable and having a low threshold. Wind direction is measured as the direction the wind is coming from.* The solar radiation sensor is an Under Water Quantum Sensor made by Licor. It measures light in terms of its "Photosynthetically Active Radiation" (PAR). The spectral response is defined and weighted. Drift due to aging of the filters has proven to be a problem, but this applies to similar units too.* Temperature sensors are all Omega Interchangeable Thermistors. These are interchangeable and have high accuracy, but reliability has proven a problem. We are considering alternatives.* The barometric sensor was a modified Aanderaa type on earlier stations. The Mk2 stations were fitted with a Weathertronics Unit. Now all stations are Mk3 stations fitted with a Vaisala barometer which is more interchangeable and more accurate.2. System AccuracySystem accuracy is calculated as the sum of errors caused by: * Calibration * Interchanging sensors * Drift with time * Effects of an ambient temperature range from 0-40 degrees C.The following are the specifications of the sensors used with Mk3 stations. A new sensor suite will be used with Mk5 stations, partly based on the Vaisala WXT510 weather sensor.Both the temperature and wind sensors are interchangeable, and not individually calibrated, though some individual sensors have been checked against standards.* Air Temperature: Interchangeable thermistor and electronics is within +/- 0.4 deg. C, with a 30 seconds settling time in air. There are additional errors due to the aspiration of the temperature screen at low wind speeds.* Water temperature: Interchangeable thermistor and electronics is within +/- 0.4 deg. C, with a 30 minutes settling time in water. A higher precision in situ calibration is normally used (around +/- 0.1 degrees), traceable to a 0.04 degrees standard.* Solar radiation (PAR): +/- 5% of reading. Sensor drift is approximately -4% per year initially.* Barometric pressure: +/- 1 hecto Pascal.* Wind speed: 2% of reading +/- 0.1% FSD.* Wind direction: 2% of reading +/- 0.1% FSD.Electrical settling time for solar radiation and wind parameters is 7 seconds. This is necessary for anti-aliasing filters. Mk1 and Mk2 stations averaged 16 samples over the 16 seconds before logging. Mk3 stations use a continuously averaging software system. The wind readings are vector averaged, so direction is accounted for properly.Calibration procedures and routines are detailed on the Engineering website.3. Wind Sensor SpecificationThe following are additional specifications of the wind sensors used with Mk3 stations. A new sensor will be used with Mk5 stations. Wind sensors are mounted at a nominal 10 meters above water. The R.M. Young sensor has the following characteristics:* Wind SpeedRange: 0-60 m/sPitch: 29.4 cm air passes per rev.Distance constant: 2.7 m for 63% recovery* Wind DirectionRange: 360 deg, with 5 deg electrically open at northDamping ratio: 0.25Delay distance: 1.5 m for 50% recoveryThreshold: 1.0 m/s @ 10 deg.Displacement: 1.5 m/s @ 5 deg. displacement Damped w/length: 7.4 mUndamped w/length: 7.2 m4. Underwater Temperature SensorsThese sensors are interchangeable thermistors in Mk3 stations. They can be mounted a significant distance from the weather station, using a 2 wire connection. The basic accuracy is due to the use of interchangeable units. However improved accuracy is obtained by calibrating against a precision reference sensor in situ. These are in turn calibrated against a standard traceable to 0.04 degrees.',

Data are made available on request to other researchers and to the public.\\n The weather station was an AIMS Mk3 System1. Operation and Weather SensorsThe weather stations collect and store data in electronic memory every half-hour. A central base station calls each remote station regularly using HF radio or telephone lines. The data is transmitted over the radio as a frequency shift keyed signal, organised as packets of information. Errors are detected using parity and check sum methods. Invalid packets are identified by the Base Station, which requests they be sent again. This concept allows recovery of a very high percentage of the data despite poor communications. Remote stations store data for 21 days. Features such as automatic operation, remote control, remote time setting, built in diagnostics, have been developed and incorporated.The sensors are a key part of a weather station. The following are chosen considering the cost, reliability and accuracy.* R.M.Young manufactures the wind sensor, a model number 05103. It is a propeller type with the advantages of being highly linear, highly interchangeable and having a low threshold. Wind direction is measured as the direction the wind is coming from.* The solar radiation sensor is an Under Water Quantum Sensor made by Licor. It measures light in terms of its \\"Photosynthetically Active Radiation\\" (PAR). The spectral response is defined and weighted. Drift due to aging of the filters has proven to be a problem, but this applies to similar units too.* Temperature sensors are all Omega Interchangeable Thermistors. These are interchangeable and have high accuracy, but reliability has proven a problem. We are considering alternatives.* The barometric sensor was a modified Aanderaa type on earlier stations. The Mk2 stations were fitted with a Weathertronics Unit. Now all stations are Mk3 stations fitted with a Vaisala barometer which is more interchangeable and more accurate.2. System AccuracySystem accuracy is calculated as the sum of errors caused by: * Calibration * Interchanging sensors * Drift with time * Effects of an ambient temperature range from 0-40 degrees C.The following are the specifications of the sensors used with Mk3 stations. A new sensor suite will be used with Mk5 stations, partly based on the Vaisala WXT510 weather sensor.Both the temperature and wind sensors are interchangeable, and not individually calibrated, though some individual sensors have been checked against standards.* Air Temperature: Interchangeable thermistor and electronics is within +/- 0.4 deg. C, with a 30 seconds settling time in air. There are additional errors due to the aspiration of the temperature screen at low wind speeds.* Solar radiation (PAR): +/- 5% of reading.

This is necessary for anti-aliasing filters. Mk1 and Mk2 stations averaged 16 samples over the 16 seconds before logging. Mk3 stations use a continuously averaging software system. The wind readings are vector averaged, so direction is accounted for properly.Calibration procedures and routines are detailed on the Engineering website.3.

        '{"title":"Lizard Island Automated Marine Weather and Oceanographic Station","recordAbstract":"Sensor network infrastructure was installed at Lizard Island in the northern Great Barrier Reef off Cooktown, Australia. The infrastructure consists of a base station mounted on the workshop of the Lizard Island Research Station (LIRS), two sensor poles that create the on-reef network and four sensor floats on which the sensors are attached. The network uses both 802.11 links and slower spread-spectrum links between the deployed equipment and a Telstra nextG link back to the mainland.\\n\\nThe sensors deployed consist of a Vaisala WXT520 weather station mounted on RP2, MEA Thermistors mounted on each of the buoys to give surface temperature and a mix of SeaBird SBE37 CTD and SeaBird SBE39 TD via inductive cables / modems on the buoys. Sensor strings (inductive cables) are run across the sea bed to position the instruments in deeper water.\\n\\n\\nThe project looks to deploy sensor networks at seven sites along the Great Barrier Reef to measure a range of physical parameters at a range of scales. The project will install communications, data and platform infrastructure that will support future sensor work looking at biological and chemical parameters.\\n\\n\\nSensor Floats: \\nA round 1.4m yellow buoy has been deployed in the southern part of the main lagoon of Lizard Island to the east of Palfrey Island. The buoy is configured as a sensor-float with a Campbell Scientific logger, spread-spectrum radio and 2.4/5 GHz 802.11 wireless for communicating with the base station (located at the workshop near the Research Station) a surface mounted (60cm under the water surface) thermistor and an inductive modem to support a range of inductive sensors, initially this will be a SeaBird SBE39 measuring temperature and pressure (depth) and a SeaBird SBE37 measuring conductivity (salinity), temperature and depth.\\n\\nAs of August 2010 the inductive sensors are located along a 30m cable that runs north into the main lagoon with a SBE39 located at the base of the buoy and the SBE37 at the end of the sensor run.The unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.\\n\\n\\nThe buoy is one of four buoys and two relay-poles being deployed on Lizard Island as part of the GBROOS Project. The design looks to measure the water within the lagoon as well as water impinging onto the reef and potentially any upwelling or movement of warm water that may cause thermal stress such as coral bleaching.\\n\\nThe buoys initially have a Campbell Scientific loggers powered off four 5W solar panels, a wind turbine and one thermistor located at the base of the buoy around 60cm below the water line. The buoys use a Campbell Scientific spread-spectrum radio as well as 802.11 Wi-Fi to talk back to Relay Pole 2 and then to Replay-Pole 1 and then to the Base Station.\\n\\n\\nWeather Stations on Relay Pole 2:\\nA Vaisala WXT520 integrated weather station has been installed on RP2, a 6m steel pole which has been installed within the lagoon of Lizard Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef. The sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of Lizard Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on Lizard Island.\\n\\nThe weather station provides measurement of air temperature (Deg. C.), humidity as relative percent, barometric pressure (milliBars or hPa), rainfall amount, intensity and duration, hail amount, intensity and duration (not common on coral reefs!) and wind speed and direction. The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values. From these you can get the average wind conditions at either 10 minute or 30 minute periods as well as the gust or maximum wind conditions.\\n\\nThe weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on Lizard Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS. Identical weather stations are also on Heron Island (southern GBR), One Tree Island (near by) and Orpheus Island (central GBR).

Data are made available on request to other researchers and to the public.\\n The weather station is an AIMS Mk3 System.Data recorded: Sea Temperature (~2m, ~4m, ~7m and ~18m at MSL), Barometric Pressure, Air Temperature, Solar Radiation (PAR), Wind Direction True (vector averaged), Wind Speed True (30 min average).This weather station has been deployed in two different locations on Myrmidon Reef.Location 1: -18.2746, 147.3830 from 1987 until June 1999Location 2: -18.267, 147.367 from June 1999 to present.1. Operation and Weather SensorsThe weather stations collect and store data in electronic memory every half-hour. A central base station calls each remote station regularly using HF radio or telephone lines. The data is transmitted over the radio as a frequency shift keyed signal, organised as packets of information. Errors are detected using parity and check sum methods. Invalid packets are identified by the Base Station, which requests they be sent again. This concept allows recovery of a very high percentage of the data despite poor communications. Remote stations store data for 21 days. Features such as automatic operation, remote control, remote time setting, built in diagnostics, have been developed and incorporated.The sensors are a key part of a weather station. The following are chosen considering the cost, reliability and accuracy.* R.M.Young manufactures the wind sensor, a model number 05103. It is a propeller type with the advantages of being highly linear, highly interchangeable and having a low threshold. Wind direction is measured as the direction the wind is coming from.* The solar radiation sensor is an Under Water Quantum Sensor made by Licor. It measures light in terms of its \\"Photosynthetically Active Radiation\\" (PAR). The spectral response is defined and weighted. Drift due to aging of the filters has proven to be a problem, but this applies to similar units too.* Temperature sensors are all Omega Interchangeable Thermistors. These are interchangeable and have high accuracy, but reliability has proven a problem. We are considering alternatives.* The barometric sensor was a modified Aanderaa type on earlier stations. The Mk2 stations were fitted with a Weathertronics Unit. Now all stations are Mk3 stations fitted with a Vaisala barometer which is more interchangeable and more accurate.2. System AccuracySystem accuracy is calculated as the sum of errors caused by: * Calibration * Interchanging sensors * Drift with time * Effects of an ambient temperature range from 0-40 degrees C.The following are the specifications of the sensors used with Mk3 stations. A new sensor suite will be used with Mk5 stations, partly based on the Vaisala WXT510 weather sensor.Both the temperature and wind sensors are interchangeable, and not individually calibrated, though some individual sensors have been checked against standards.* Air Temperature: Interchangeable thermistor and electronics is within +/- 0.4 deg. C, with a 30 seconds settling time in air. There are additional errors due to the aspiration of the temperature screen at low wind speeds.* Water temperature: Interchangeable thermistor and electronics is within +/- 0.4 deg. C, with a 30 minutes settling time in water. A higher precision in situ calibration is normally used (around +/- 0.1 degrees), traceable to a 0.04 degrees standard.* Solar radiation (PAR): +/- 5% of reading. Sensor drift is approximately -4% per year initially.* Barometric pressure: +/- 1 hecto Pascal.* Wind speed: 2% of reading +/- 0.1% FSD.* Wind direction: 2% of reading +/- 0.1% FSD.Electrical settling time for solar radiation and wind parameters is 7 seconds. This is necessary for anti-aliasing filters. Mk1 and Mk2 stations averaged 16 samples over the 16 seconds before logging. Mk3 stations use a continuously averaging software system. The wind readings are vector averaged, so direction is accounted for properly.Calibration procedures and routines are detailed on the Engineering website.3. Wind Sensor SpecificationThe following are additional specifications of the wind sensors used with Mk3 stations. A new sensor will be used with Mk5 stations. Wind sensors are mounted at a nominal 10 meters above water. The R.M. Young sensor has the following characteristics:* Wind SpeedRange: 0-60 m/sPitch: 29.4 cm air passes per rev.Distance constant: 2.7 m for 63% recovery* Wind DirectionRange: 360 deg, with 5 deg electrically open at northDamping ratio: 0.25Delay distance: 1.5 m for 50% recoveryThreshold: 1.0 m/s @ 10 deg.Displacement: 1.5 m/s @ 5 deg. displacement Damped w/length: 7.4 mUndamped w/length: 7.2 m4. Underwater Temperature SensorsThese sensors are interchangeable thermistors in Mk3 stations. They can be mounted a significant distance from the weather station, using a 2 wire connection. The basic accuracy is due to the use of interchangeable units. However improved accuracy is obtained by calibrating against a precision reference sensor in situ. These are in turn calibrated against a standard traceable to 0.04 degrees."}',

C, with a 30 seconds settling time in air. There are additional errors due to the aspiration of the temperature screen at low wind speeds.* Water temperature: Interchangeable thermistor and electronics is within +/- 0.4 deg. C, with a 30 minutes settling time in water. A higher precision in situ calibration is normally used (around +/- 0.1 degrees), traceable to a 0.04 degrees standard.* Solar radiation (PAR): +/- 5% of reading. Sensor drift is approximately -4% per year initially.* Barometric pressure: +/- 1 hecto Pascal.* Wind speed: 2% of reading +/- 0.1% FSD.* Wind direction: 2% of reading +/- 0.1% FSD.Electrical settling time for solar radiation and wind parameters is 7 seconds. This is necessary for anti-aliasing filters. Mk1 and Mk2 stations averaged 16 samples over the 16 seconds before logging. Mk3 stations use a continuously averaging software system. The wind readings are vector averaged, so direction is accounted for properly.Calibration procedures and routines are detailed on the Engineering website.3. Wind Sensor SpecificationThe following are additional specifications of the wind sensors used with Mk3 stations. A new sensor will be used with Mk5 stations. Wind sensors are mounted at a nominal 10 meters above water. The R.M. Young sensor has the following characteristics:* Wind SpeedRange: 0-60 m/sPitch: 29.4 cm air passes per rev.Distance constant: 2.7 m for 63% recovery* Wind DirectionRange: 360 deg, with 5 deg electrically open at northDamping ratio: 0.25Delay distance: 1.5 m for 50% recoveryThreshold: 1.0 m/s @ 10 deg.Displacement: 1.5 m/s @ 5 deg. displacement Damped w/length: 7.4 mUndamped w/length: 7.2 m4. Underwater Temperature SensorsThese sensors are interchangeable thermistors in Mk3 stations. They can be mounted a significant distance from the weather station, using a 2 wire connection. The basic accuracy is due to the use of interchangeable units. However improved accuracy is obtained by calibrating against a precision reference sensor in situ. These are in turn calibrated against a standard traceable to 0.04 degrees."}',

Operation and Weather SensorsThe weather stations collect and store data in electronic memory every half-hour. A central base station calls each remote station regularly using HF radio or telephone lines. The data is transmitted over the radio as a frequency shift keyed signal, organised as packets of information. Errors are detected using parity and check sum methods. Invalid packets are identified by the Base Station, which requests they be sent again. This concept allows recovery of a very high percentage of the data despite poor communications. Remote stations store data for 21 days. Features such as automatic operation, remote control, remote time setting, built in diagnostics, have been developed and incorporated.The sensors are a key part of a weather station. The following are chosen considering the cost, reliability and accuracy.* R.M.Young manufactures the wind sensor, a model number 05103. It is a propeller type with the advantages of being highly linear, highly interchangeable and having a low threshold. Wind direction is measured as the direction the wind is coming from.* The solar radiation sensor is an Under Water Quantum Sensor made by Licor.

        '{"title":"Davies Reef Deployments of the Wireless Sensor Network","recordAbstract":"Sensor network infrastructure was installed at Davies Reef in the central Great Barrier Reef off Townsville, Australia. The infrastructure consists of a base station mounted on the existing reef communications tower and a number of buoys which carry the actual sensors.\\n\\nThe initial design is to monitor the flow of water through the lagoon, the connectivity between the lagoon and the open ocean and the presence of an upwelling signal as oceanic water crosses the open shelf in the Townsville region. This site is linked to ones on the edge of the shelf (Myrmidon Reef) and sites closer in such as Rib Reef and Orpheus Island.\\n\\nThe deployment in December 2009 consisted of the base station using the Telstra nextG service and five buoys or sensor floats. The sensor floats carry a mixture of sensors but typically a surface MEA Thermistor and a bottom mounted SeaBird SBE39 (temp + pressure), for some floats the SBE39 is replaced by a SBE37 to give salinity (as conductivity), temperature and presure.\\n\\nOn the tower is a vaisala WXT520 weather station.\\n\\n\\nThe project looks to deploy sensor networks at seven sites along the Great Barrier Reef to measure a range of physical parameters at a range of scales. The project will install communications, data and platform infrastructure that will support future sensor work looking at biological and chemical parameters.\\n\\n\\nWireless Sensor Networks Facility (formerly known as Facility for The Automated Intelligent Monitoring of Marine Systems (FAIMMS)), part of the Great Barrier Reef Ocean Observing System project (GBROOS) (IMOS)"}',
