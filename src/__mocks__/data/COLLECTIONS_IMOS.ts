        "This dataset describes the Data Quality Control Flags and Descriptions used by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) National Reference Station sampling sites.\n\nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). \n\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\n\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\n\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\n\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is freely available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au",

      description:
        "IMOS is designed to be a fully-integrated, national system, observing at ocean-basin and regional scales, and covering physical, chemical and biological variables. IMOS Facilities, operated by ten different institutions within the National Innovation System, are funded to deploy equipment and deliver data streams for use by the entire Australian marine and climate science community and its international collaborators.\nThe IMOS Ocean Portal (http://imos.aodn.org.au) allows marine and climate scientists and other users to discover and explore data streams coming from all of the Facilities – some in near-real time, and all as delayed-mode, quality-controlled data. These data streams, long time-series that are ‘under construction’, represent the actual research infrastructure being created and developed by IMOS.\nIMOS observations are guided by science planning undertaken collaboratively across the Australian marine and climate science community. IMOS now has a National Science and Implementation Plan that draws on the intellectual strength of its six science Nodes – a ‘Bluewater and Climate’ Node focused on the open ocean, and five ‘Regional Nodes’ covering the continental shelf and coastal seas of Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Southern Australia and Tasmania. Leaders of the Nodes come together to form a national steering committee that oversees the whole process, and IMOS science plans are subjected to international peer review on a rolling basis to ensure the planned science is world-class. \n\nThere are five major research themes that unify IMOS science plans and related observations:\n1. Multi-decadal ocean change,\n2. Climate variability and weather extremes\n3. Major boundary currents and interbasin flows\n4. Continental shelf processes, and\n5. Ecosystem responses (productivity, abundance and distribution).\n\nIMOS is supported by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy and the Super Science Initiative. It is led by the University of Tasmania on behalf of the Australian marine and climate science community.",

Our ships of opportunity include both commercial vessels on regular routes and research vessels covering more varied routes. \\nThe target regions are the boundary current systems off Eastern and Western Australia, the Southern Ocean, the shelf seas across northern Australia, and the Great Barrier Reef. This is achieved by the following specific goals:\\n1.\\tImplement vessels on suitable routes with an integrated system of measurements including physical and biogeochemical parameters \\na.\\tMonitor the major boundary currents systems around Australia.\\nb.\\tMonitor both local processes and the interactions of the boundary currents on the continental shelf \\n2.\\tProvide in situ input and/or validation to model and data analyses covering the waters around Australia.\\n\\nInstrument Platforms\\n\\nHigh-density XBT Sections - Five major (HRX) high-resolution XBT lines provide boundary to boundary profiling, closely spaced sampling to resolve mesoscale eddies, fronts and boundary currents. The lines are repeated 4 times per year with an on-board technician. The routes sample each major boundary current system using available commercial vessel traffic. All of the transects transmit data in real-time.\\n \\nBiogeochemical Program - uses the RV Southern Surveyor and the l\' Astrolabe which sample the critical regions of the Southern Ocean and Australian waters, which have a major impact on CO2 uptake by the ocean and are regions where biogeochemical cycling is predicted to be sensitive to changing climate. Southern Surveyor has a wide spatial coverage and each year covers tropical to sub-polar waters. \\n\\nAusCPR - To monitor plankton we use the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR), the only platform that can assess plankton species and be towed behind ships of opportunity. Species-level data are vital to examine mesoscale productivity, biodiversity, and climate impacts on marine ecosystems. Two seasonal routes are operated, in the Southern Ocean, and the East Australian Current\\n\\nSensors on Tropical Research Vessels - Fixed sensor sets maintained on the 2 tropical research vessels (RV Cape Ferguson and RV Solander). The instruments obtain underway observations of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, fluorescence, light absorption, and irradiance. \\n\\nSST Sensors - Implemented on Australian Volunteer Observing Fleet (AVOF) vessels and several passenger ferries. Hull-mounted sensors supply high-quality bulk SST data fed into existing data management systems and broadcast via satellite back to Australia every one to three hours. Radiometers on ferries supply high-quality skin SST data in near real-time. \\n\\nResearch Vessel Real-time Air-Sea Fluxes - Research vessels have been equipped with \\"climate quality\\" met. systems, providing high quality air-sea flux measurements and delivered in near real-time.

A \'sensor network\' is an array of small, wirelessly interconnected sensors that collectively stream sensor data to a central data aggregation point. Sensor networks can be used to provide spatially dense bio-physical measurements in real-time. In the marine environment they have particular application to the study of benthic ecosystems. Some sensors can be set to sample according to prevailing conditions (e.g. monitoring salinity more frequently after rainfall), but since communications with the sensors can be bi-directional they can also be manipulated by central land-based control systems. FAIMMS sensors collect data related to the interaction of heat and light in coral bleaching, and to help understand the impact of upwelling from the Coral Sea upon the productivity of Great Barrier Reef ecosystems. While sensor networks are a leading edge technology, they are well suited to this application because proven technologies exist for reliable sensing of physical variables (e.g. temperature, salinity, light) critical to the immediate scientific questions, which are: 1. understanding the interaction of heat and light in coral bleaching, and 2. understanding the impact of upwelling from the Coral Sea upon the productivity of GBR ecosystems. The immediate value of the network will be its ability to return spatially dense bio-physical measurements in real-time. As such this represents a large scale trial or \\"proof of concept\\" of a very important emerging technology for application in the marine environment with particular relevance to benthic ecosystems such as Great Barrier Reef and other benthic environments. Some sites have been partially or fully decommissioned in regards to IMOS: Heron Island (2008 - present) - partial; One Tree Island (2008 - present) - partial; Davies Reef (2009 - 2018); Myrmidon Reef (2009 - 2015); Rib Reef (2009 - 2017); Orpheus Island (2009 - present); Lizard Island (2010 - present) - partial.

Autonomous ocean gliders can be built relatively cheaply, are controlled remotely and are reusable allowing them to make repeated subsurface ocean observations at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods. The data retrieved from the glider fleet will contribute to the study of the major boundary current systems surrounding Australia and their links to coastal ecosystems.\\n\\nThe ANFOG glider fleet consists of two types; Slocum gliders and Seagliders. \\nSlocum gliders (named for Joshua Slocum, the first solo global circumnavigator), manufactured by Webb Research Corp are optimised for shallow coastal waters (<200m) where high manoeuvrability is needed. ANFOG will have Slocum gliders for deployment on the continental shelf. Seagliders, built at the University of Washington, are designed to operate more efficiently in the open ocean up to 1000m water depth. ANFOG uses their Seagliders to monitor the boundary currents and continental shelves, which is valuable for gathering long-term environmental records of physical, chemical and biological data not widely measured to date. Whilst the Slocum gliders, due to their low cost and operational flexibility, will be of great use in intensive coastal monitoring, both types of gliders weigh only 52kg, enabling them to be launched from small boats. They have a suite of sensors able to record temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll against position and depth\\n\\nThe use of these contemporary gliders provides a unique opportunity to effectively measure the boundary currents off Australia, which are the main link between open-ocean and coastal processes.

Our ships of opportunity include both commercial vessels on regular routes and research vessels covering more varied routes. \\nThe target regions are the boundary current systems off Eastern and Western Australia, the Southern Ocean, the shelf seas across northern Australia, and the Great Barrier Reef. This is achieved by the following specific goals:\\n1.\\tImplement vessels on suitable routes with an integrated system of measurements including physical and biogeochemical parameters \\na.\\tMonitor the major boundary currents systems around Australia.\\nb.\\tMonitor both local processes and the interactions of the boundary currents on the continental shelf \\n2.\\tProvide in situ input and/or validation to model and data analyses covering the waters around Australia.\\n\\nInstrument Platforms\\n\\nHigh-density XBT Sections - Five major (HRX) high-resolution XBT lines provide boundary to boundary profiling, closely spaced sampling to resolve mesoscale eddies, fronts and boundary currents. The lines are repeated 4 times per year with an on-board technician. The routes sample each major boundary current system using available commercial vessel traffic. All of the transects transmit data in real-time.\\n \\nBiogeochemical Program - uses the RV Southern Surveyor and the l\' Astrolabe which sample the critical regions of the Southern Ocean and Australian waters, which have a major impact on CO2 uptake by the ocean and are regions where biogeochemical cycling is predicted to be sensitive to changing climate. Southern Surveyor has a wide spatial coverage and each year covers tropical to sub-polar waters. \\n\\nAusCPR - To monitor plankton we use the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR), the only platform that can assess plankton species and be towed behind ships of opportunity. Species-level data are vital to examine mesoscale productivity, biodiversity, and climate impacts on marine ecosystems. Two seasonal routes are operated, in the Southern Ocean, and the East Australian Current\\n\\nSensors on Tropical Research Vessels - Fixed sensor sets maintained on the 2 tropical research vessels (RV Cape Ferguson and RV Solander). The instruments obtain underway observations of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, fluorescence, light absorption, and irradiance. \\n\\nSST Sensors - Implemented on Australian Volunteer Observing Fleet (AVOF) vessels and several passenger ferries.

Autonomous ocean gliders can be built relatively cheaply, are controlled remotely and are reusable allowing them to make repeated subsurface ocean observations at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods. The data retrieved from the glider fleet will contribute to the study of the major boundary current systems surrounding Australia and their links to coastal ecosystems.\\n\\nThe ANFOG glider fleet consists of two types; Slocum gliders and Seagliders. \\nSlocum gliders (named for Joshua Slocum, the first solo global circumnavigator), manufactured by Webb Research Corp are optimised for shallow coastal waters (<200m) where high manoeuvrability is needed. ANFOG will have Slocum gliders for deployment on the continental shelf. Seagliders, built at the University of Washington, are designed to operate more efficiently in the open ocean up to 1000m water depth. ANFOG uses their Seagliders to monitor the boundary currents and continental shelves, which is valuable for gathering long-term environmental records of physical, chemical and biological data not widely measured to date. Whilst the Slocum gliders, due to their low cost and operational flexibility, will be of great use in intensive coastal monitoring, both types of gliders weigh only 52kg, enabling them to be launched from small boats. They have a suite of sensors able to record temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll against position and depth\\n\\nThe use of these contemporary gliders provides a unique opportunity to effectively measure the boundary currents off Australia, which are the main link between open-ocean and coastal processes.

A \'sensor network\' is an array of small, wirelessly interconnected sensors that collectively stream sensor data to a central data aggregation point. Sensor networks can be used to provide spatially dense bio-physical measurements in real-time. In the marine environment they have particular application to the study of benthic ecosystems. Some sensors can be set to sample according to prevailing conditions (e.g. monitoring salinity more frequently after rainfall), but since communications with the sensors can be bi-directional they can also be manipulated by central land-based control systems. FAIMMS sensors collect data related to the interaction of heat and light in coral bleaching, and to help understand the impact of upwelling from the Coral Sea upon the productivity of Great Barrier Reef ecosystems. While sensor networks are a leading edge technology, they are well suited to this application because proven technologies exist for reliable sensing of physical variables (e.g. temperature, salinity, light) critical to the immediate scientific questions, which are: 1. understanding the interaction of heat and light in coral bleaching, and 2. understanding the impact of upwelling from the Coral Sea upon the productivity of GBR ecosystems. The immediate value of the network will be its ability to return spatially dense bio-physical measurements in real-time. As such this represents a large scale trial or \\"proof of concept\\" of a very important emerging technology for application in the marine environment with particular relevance to benthic ecosystems such as Great Barrier Reef and other benthic environments.

Ocean basin-scale bioacoustic data from ships of opportunity programs are increasingly improving this situation by providing spatio-temporal calibrated acoustic snapshots of mesopelagic communities that can mutually complement established global ecosystem, carbon, and biogeochemical models. This data descriptor provides an overview of such bioacoustic data from Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Bioacoustics Ships of Opportunity Program. Until 30 September 2020, more than 600,000 km of data from 22 platforms have been processed. Approximately 67% of total data holdings were collected by 13 commercial fishing vessels, fostering collaborations between researchers and ocean industry.\\n\\nA snapshot of this data (up to 30/09/2020) has been assigned a DOI and will be maintained in perpetuity by the Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN).

This SOOP dataset covers the Indian Ocean and waters south and east of Australia and across to New Zealand. BASOOP commenced on the 1st of July 2010 to collect underway acoustic data while vessels are transiting ocean basins. At present, nine vessels are participating in the BASOOP program. Six are commercial fishing vessels that have agreed to record data during transits to and from fishing grounds. The remaining three are scientific research vessels collecting underway acoustic data during transits and science operations. Bio acoustic signals allow understanding how mid-water prey species (known collectively as micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish are distributed. Micronekton form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds. The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. The mapping complements established observing systems such as physical sampling of ocean currents, surveys of ocean chemistry and biology (plankton and zooplankton), and electronic tagging and tracking of large marine fish and mammals. The combined information greatly enhances the capacity of marine scientists to monitor shifts in food availability over time, assisting in the monitoring and modelling of oceanography, ecosystems, fisheries and climate change, and in understanding the behaviour of top predators. Data Collection: All BASOOP vessels collect 38 kHz acoustic data from either Simrad EK60, ES60 (split beam) or ES70 echosounders. In all cases the 38 kHz echosounders are connected to Simrad ES38B transducers. This is a narrow-beam (7 o) ceramic transducer with good long term stability and manufacturer supplied calibration parameters. Research vessel Southern Surveyor also collects concurrent acoustic data at 12 and 120 kHz. The research vessel Aurora Australis collects concurrent acoustic data at 12, 120 and 200 kHz. The primary data-type recorded from the vessel-mounted echosounder systems is georeferenced calibrated water column volume backscatter, Sv [dB re 1 m-1], (Maclennan et al. 2002) . The raw acoustic data is post processed to (i) identify on-transit data and prioritise processing, (ii) apply calibration offsets, (iii) apply semi-automated filters to identify and reject bad data and (iv) create output stored in netCDF format, mean echointegrated Sv for cells of 1000 m distance and 10 m height. A full metadata record is also stored in each netCDF file. Reference: *Maclennan, D.N., Fernandes, P.G., and Dalen, J. 2002. A consistent approach to definitions and symbols in fisheries acoustics.

In order to improve calibration and validation of satellite SST in the Australian region, there is a need for high quality in situ SST observations with greater timeliness, spatial and temporal coverage than is currently available. Regions particularly lacking in moored or drifting buoy observations are the Western Pacific Tropical Warm Pool region (Indonesia), close to the Australian coast (including Bass Strait) and the Southern Ocean. Current ship SST observations from ships of opportunity (SOOP) are either of questionable accuracy or difficult to access in a timely manner. \\n\\nThere are five vessels carrying automatic weather stations (AWS) that participate in the Australian Volunteer Observing Fleet (AVOF) program and two vessels equipped with a newly designed system for real-time SST data acquisition. Their routes include the Southern Ocean, coastal Australia (Queensland to South Australia), Bass Strait, Pacific Ocean, South-East Asia and the Tasman Sea. Four AVOF vessels with hull-mounted temperature sensors (Sea Bird SBE 48) and one with a digital oceanographic thermometer (Sea Bird SBE 38, RV L’Astrolabe) are supplying high-quality bulk SST data hourly. There is also one passenger ferry that is currently taking SST measurements using the high-accuracy SBE 38 sensor (MV SeaFlyte – Hillarys Harbour-Rottnest Island). In addition, there are now near real-time SST data streams available from two Australian research vessels (RV Southern Surveyor and RSV Aurora Australis), one New Zealand research vessel (RV Tangaroa), and a small research vessel operated by CSIRO near the south-east coast of Western Australia (RV Linnaeus). In total, twelve vessels send SST data in real-time. All SST data are being quality assured, placed on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and fed into the Bureau of Meteorology\'s near real-time satellite SST data validation system and operational regional and global SST analyses. Additionally, there are historical SST observations from four vessels which are not currently available in real-time: passenger ferry MV Fantasea, Whitsundays area, radiometer and bulk SST (November 2008 to March 2010); two AVOF vessels: MV Iron Yandi (February 2010 to January 2011) and PV Pacific Sun (December 2010 to July 2012); and one Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS), MV Pacific Celebes which has been carrying high-quality scientific equipment (January 2008 to March 2012)."}',

      description:
        'The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project of CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia\'s oceans. The phytoplankton abundance data are analysed as per Richardson et al 2006. Phytoplankton are usually counted from water samples after settling but in the CPR analysis we count the phytoplankton in situ. With CPR samples, the phytoplankton is captured by the mesh and are caught by the silk strands, by phytoplankton mucilage, and/or by other organisms on the silk. It is thus possible to see the phytoplankton cells directly on the mesh. In essence, the phytoplankton is already concentrated. Washing the phytoplankton off the silks to count in the standard manner may result in loss of or damage to cells before analysis. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models. Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&A laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section. Source: https://marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c1344979-f701-0916-e044-00144f7bc0f4. For information on using the data please refer to Richardson et al. 2006. It is advised that anyone using the data should read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The data are made available in binned products for ease of use. As taxonomy changes over time and the ability of analysts improves with training more and more species are able to be identified over time. The products account for these changes and for real absences from the samples. A 0 abundance means that the species was looked for and not seen, -999 means that the species was not looked for in that sample. The products are therefore applicable for use in time series analysis. There are 5 products to choose from: Raw product (includes all data); Species product (includes all data where species have been identified); Genus product (includes all data binned to genus level); Higher taxonomic group (includes all data binned to functional groups); Derived CPR Indices. The raw product contains the same information as the raw "flat table" form, but the absences have been added in and the taxonomic changes have been accounted for, for ease of use. Note: the binned and pivoted products described are currently only available by contacting imos-plankton@csiro.au. The latest raw data can be downloaded in "flat table" form (separate row for each taxon in each sample) on Step 3. **All files are available in bio-volume instead of abundance on request.**\n\n**This dataset has been superseded by the "IMOS - Phytoplankton Abundance and Biovolume (CPR)" collection that is available at  https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/api/records/8e594cd1-363a-4b58-b741-9fa3624adb77 (this collection was removed from the AODN Portal in March 2022).**',

The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a dissecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.

The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours. It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models. Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure.

      description:
        'These data sets include the picoplankton component analysed by flow cytometry from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network -National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. Nine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). Sampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled, sample regime, sample types collected, and analyses can be found in the “IMOS National Reference Stations Biogeochemical Operations Manual” (see link below to latest version, plus link to previous versions and supplementary documentation). Historical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites: Maria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.

In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down.

Based on its small size, it can be deployed from RHIBs and other small vessels. The main objective of the IMOS AUV Facility is to support sustained observations of the benthos, in support of the IMOS integrated benthic monitoring program. . The AUV facility is based at the Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR) within the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering at the University of Sydney.\\n\\nThis IMOS Facility finished in June 2023, with data still available through the AODN Portal."}',

      description:
        'The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia\'s oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a dissecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models. Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section. Additional information for this dataset may be available via the original MarLIN metadata entry: https://marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c1344e70-480e-0993-e044-00144f7bc0f4. For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. It is advised that anyone using the data should read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The data are made available in binned products for ease of use. As taxonomy changes over time and the ability of analysts improves with training more and more species are able to be identified over time. The products account for these changes and for real absences from the samples. A 0 abundance means that the species was looked for and not seen, -999 means that the species was not looked for in that sample. The products are therefore applicable for use time series analysis. There are 6 files to choose from: Raw file (includes all data, including sex and stage); Copepod species file (includes all copepod data where species have been identified); Non copepod species file (includes all non copepod data where species have been identified); Genus file (includes all data binned to genus level); Higher taxonomic group (includes all data binned to functional groups); Derived CPR Indices. The raw product contains the same information as the raw "flat table" form, but the absences have been added in and the taxonomic changes have been accounted for, for ease of use. Note: the binned and pivoted products described are currently only available by contacting imos-plankton@csiro.au. The latest raw data can be downloaded in "flat table" form (separate row for each taxon in each sample) on Step 3. **All files are available in bio-volume instead of abundance on request.**\n\n**This dataset has been superseded by the "IMOS - Zooplankton Abundance and Biomass Index (CPR)" collection that is available at https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/api/records/bf287dfe-9ce4-4969-9c59-51c39ea4d011 (this collection was removed from the AODN Portal in March 2022).**',

The phytoplankton abundance data are analysed as per Richardson et al 2006. Phytoplankton are usually counted from water samples after settling but in the CPR analysis we count the phytoplankton in situ. With CPR samples, the phytoplankton is captured by the mesh and are caught by the silk strands, by phytoplankton mucilage, and/or by other organisms on the silk. It is thus possible to see the phytoplankton cells directly on the mesh. In essence, the phytoplankton is already concentrated.

      description:
        "The IMOS Biogeochemical Argo sub-facility aims to undertake real time monitoring of the broad ocean state around Australia by deploying Biogeochemical Argo floats in scientifically important areas of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone, surrounding seas and the Southern Ocean. The data presented here, includes all Biogeochemical Argo profiles collected since 2002, and covers the oceans worldwide. In collaboration with the US SOCCOM project, the first IMOS Australia Biogeochemical Argo floats were deployed in the East Australia Current in September 2019. Biogeochemical Argo floats are profiling floats that, in addition to temperature and salinity (this data is provided by the IMOS - Argo Profiles - core data collection, https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/4402cb50-e20a-44ee-93e6-4728259250d2), carry sensors to measure any combination of dissolved oxygen, pH, dissolved nitrate, chlorophyll fluorescence, particulate backscatter and incoming solar radiation (data provided for the first 4 variables only).\n\nA typical Argo float mission is to profile from 2000 m depth to the sea surface every 10 days. On deployment, the float sinks to a depth of 1000 m and drifts with the ocean currents for 9 days. Then the float sinks deeper to its profile depth (usually 2000 m) before starting to ascend through the water column measuring parameters as it rises. Once at the surface it transmits location and profile data via satellite to land-based Argo data centres. After transmission the float sinks again and repeats the cycle. \n\nEach Argo float is identified by a unique identification number called a WMO ID. WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) ID Numbers are assigned to measurement stations and observing platforms to enable researchers to keep track of, and uniquely identify their floats. The average life of the latest model APEX Argo floats are around 3.7 years or approximately 135 cycles. These statistics are for floats with the standard alkaline battery configuration from an analysis by Kobayashi et al (2009). In the Australian Argo program, the floats are deployed with a combination of lithium and alkaline battery packs which extends float lifetime. Argo Australia floats usually last 5 years.",

The noise loggers record sound emitted by natural processes in the ocean and sources of biological origin, such as marine mammals, crustaceans and fish, which have unique acoustic signatures. Through an analysis of these signals, it is possible to discriminate and identify different species and to assess the number of animals present within the range of acoustic observation, which can then be linked to ocean productivity. Large animals can also be located by a horizontal array of sea noise loggers constituting a passive acoustic observatory. IMOS operated acoustic observatories at four sites: 1) Perth Canyon in Western Australia, 2) off Portland in South Australia, 3) near Tuncurry (Forster) in New South Wales, and 4) west of Kangaroo Island in South Australia (these sites were decommissioned in 2017/2018).

The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year.

      description:
        'As part of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), the Australian Bureau of Meteorology produce high-resolution satellite sea surface temperature (SST) products over the Australian region, designed to suit a range of operational and research applications.  All these products follow the latest International Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST: www.ghrsst.org) file formats, assisting international data exchange and collaboration.\nThe highest spatial resolution (1 km x 1 km) data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors on NOAA polar-orbiting satellites can only be obtained through receiving direct broadcast “HRPT” data from the satellite.  In Australia, HRPT data is received by a number of agencies (Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia, AIMS and CSIRO) and consortia (WASTAC and TERSS) at ground-stations located in Darwin, Townsville, Melbourne, Hobart, Perth and Alice Springs and in Antarctica at Casey and Davis Stations.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology, in collaboration with CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, is combining raw data from the various ground-stations and producing real-time HRPT AVHRR skin (~ 10 micron depth) SST data files in the GHRSST GDS v2.0 L2P (single swath, geolocated), L3U (single swath, gridded), one and three day daytime/night-time L3C (single sensor, multiple swath, gridded) and one, three and six day daytime/night-time L3S (multiple sensors, multiple swath, gridded) formats.  The L2P, L3U, L3C and L3S files for NOAA-15, 17, 18 and 19 satellite data are available through the IMOS FTP server (ftp://aodaac2-cbr.act.csiro.au/imos/GHRSST), IMOS AO-DAAC (http://www.marine.csiro.au/remotesensing/imos/aggregator.html# ) and IMOS Ocean Portal (http://imos.aodn.org.au/webportal/), and will eventually be available through the GHRSST Global Data Assembly Centre (http://ghrsst.jpl.nasa.gov).  Archived raw HRPT AVHRR data from Australian and Antarctic ground-stations back to 1992 will be progressively reprocessed into skin SST L2P, L3U, L3C and L3S files and be available to GHRSST and IMOS by June 2013.\nFor the user, there are several advantages to using GHRSST-format SST products.  For each SST value the GHRSST files contain a quality level flag (based on proximity to cloud, satellite zenith angle and day/night) and bias and standard deviation error estimates based on 60 day match-ups with drifting buoy SST data.  Note that the closer an SST pixel is to cloud, the higher the standard deviation.  Therefore, the presence of these quality level flags and error information enable users to tailor the L2P, L3U, L3C or L3S files for their particular research application by trading SST spatial coverage for accuracy and vice versa.  Users have the ability to access L3U, L3C and L3S SST products through IMOS OPeNDAP servers, greatly simplifying data access and extraction.  Providing real-time HRPT AVHRR SST files in GHRSST-L2P format enables them to be incorporated into global and regional, gap-free, analyses of L2P SST from multiple satellites such as NASA’s G1SST global 1 km daily SST analysis and the Bureau of Meteorology’s daily regional and global SST analyses (RAMSSA and GAMSSA).\nThe new IMOS AVHRR L2P SSTs exhibit approximately 75% the error of the Bureau’s pre-existing HRPT AVHRR level 2 SST data, with standard deviations compared with drifting buoys during night-time of around 0.3°C and during daytime of around 0.4°C for quality level 5 (highest). This significant improvement in accuracy has been achieved by improving cloud clearing and calibration - using regional rather than global drifting buoy SST observations and incorporating a dependence on latitude.\nFor further details on the AVHRR GHRSST products see Paltoglou et al. (2010) (http://imos.org.au/srsdoc.html).  Enquiries can be directed to Helen Beggs (h.beggs(at)bom.gov.au).\n\n\nAll the IMOS satellite SST products are supplied in GHRSST netCDF format and are either geolocated swath ("L2P") files or level 3 composite, gridded files that will have gaps where there were no observations during the specified time period.  The various L3U (single swath), L3C (single sensor, multiple swath) and L3S (multiple sensors, multiple swaths) are designed to suit different applications.  Some current applications of the various IMOS satellite SST products are:\n\nHRPT AVHRR data:\n\nL2P: Ingestion into optimally interpolated SST analysis systems (eg. RAMSSA, GAMSSA, G1SST, ODYSSEA);\n\nL3U: Calculation of surface ocean currents (IMOS OceanCurrents);\n\nL3C: Estimation of diurnal warming of the surface ocean (GHRSST Tropical Warm Pool Diurnal Variation (TWP+) Project);\n\nL3S: Estimation of likelihood of coral bleaching events (ReefTemp II).\n\nL3P: Legacy 14-day Mosaic AVHRR SST which is a weighted mean SST produced daily from multiple NOAA satellites in a cut-down GHRSST netCDF format.  This product is still used in a coral bleaching prediction system run at CMAR.  The product is produced using the legacy BoM processing system and is less accurate than the new IMOS L3S product.\n\nGeostationary satellite MTSAT-1R data:\n\nL3U: Hourly, 0.05 deg x 0.05 deg SST used for estimation of the diurnal warming of the surface ocean and validation of diurnal warming models (TWP+ Project).',

These multi-spectral measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), most typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water. \\n\\nThe data are produced from the near real time (nrt) data stream formed by combining data from all the available direct broadcast reception stations in Australia (Alice Springs, Melbourne, Townsville, Perth, Hobart). The data are presented as a sequence of granules, each with a maximum size corresponding to 5 minutes of data, and beginning on UTC-5 minute boundary (eg. 04:05, 04:10, 04:15). The granules have been remapped from satellite projection into a geographic (Latitude/Longitude axes) projection and are formatted as CF-compliant netCDF files. It should be noted that the data are not processed until the definitive spacecraft ephemeris becomes available, usually 12-24 hours after the overpass. This means that the geolocation should be of a uniformly high standard.\\n\\nThere are multiple retrieval algorithms for estimating Chl-a. These data use the OC3 method recommended by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group and implemented in the SeaDAS processing software l2gen. The radiometric sensitivity of the MODIS sensor is evolving continuously during its mission and is being monitored regularly. The SeaDAS software uses tables of calibration coefficients that are updated periodically. From time to time upgrades to the algorithms and thand/or the format of the calibration tables are required, in which case a new version of SeaDAS is released. These data are initially being produced using SeaDAS 6.1, then SeaDAS 6.4 and eventually with SeaDAS 7.x. The data processed with each different version can be distinguished by the digits at the end of the root URL for the data; for example l2oc.nrt.61 is level-2 ocean colour (l2oc), using the near real time (nrt) data stream, produced using SeaDAS 6.1."}',

These altimeter satellites essentially observe the height of the global oceans – as such, they have become the tool of choice for scientists to measure sea level rise – both at regional and global scales as well as giving information about ocean currents and large- and small-scale variability. The determination of changes in global mean sea level is of fundamental importance in understanding the response of the ocean to a continuing warming climate – both through thermal expansion of the ocean, melting of the major ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, and mountain glaciers, and redistribution of water over the continents and atmosphere. As with all scientific observations, it is vital that the measurement tool is operating within its specifications – calibration and validation is therefore an important component in this regard. \\n\\nThis IMOS sub-facility provides the sole southern hemisphere in situ calibration site to provide an ongoing calibration and validation data stream directly to the international (NASA and CNES sponsored) Ocean Surface Topography Science Team (OSTST). This contribution, importantly, spans multiple altimeter missions, thus enabling the assimilation of multi-mission satellite data to determine ongoing changes in sea level with flow-on effects to other uses of this data. The OSTST collectively oversees the operation and calibration of the precision altimetry missions, and ensures each of these missions is performing as accurately as possible in order to meet mission objectives. The IMOS supported calibration site in Australia is one of four primary in situ calibration/validation sites that contribute to the OSTST. The remaining sites include Harvest (USA), Corsica (France), and Gavdos (Greece). The Australian calibration site includes two comparison points where in situ data is compared against the altimeter – Bass Strait and Storm Bay. These two locations both lie on descending (N -> S) pass 088 of the satellite altimeter, and thus share similar satellite orbit characteristics. The use of these two sites allows detailed investigation into the accuracy of the altimeter over two different wave climates. The average significant wave height at Storm Bay is approximately double that observed at the comparatively sheltered Bass Strait location. One of the ongoing issues with satellite altimeter missions is the “Sea-state bias” correction which is related to wave shape and height. We plan to use the different wave climates at the two locations, coupled with the fact that some other things (such as orbit errors) are the same at both locations to improve the quality of this correction."}',

This SRS dataset covers the southern oceans worldwide and Indonesian waters. The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) are providing some of the data to the bio-optical database. This activity aims to collate measurements undertaken prior to the commencement of IMOS by several members of the Australian biological oceanography community. This database is used to assess accuracy of Satellite ocean colour products for current and forthcoming satellite missions for the Australian Waters. The bio-optical database underpins the assessment of ocean colour products in the Australian region (e.g. chlorophyll a concentrations, phytoplankton species composition and primary production). Such a data set is crucial to quantify the uncertainty in the ocean colour products in our region. Further, it is essential to assessing new ocean colour data products generated for the Australian region. The contribution of such a database to international space agencies ensures that the accuracy of global algorithm developed for future sensors will increase for Australian waters as bias towards Northern Hemisphere observation will be reduced. The database contains biooptical data (i.e. HPLC, Chlorophyll by spectrophotometric methods, full spectral absorptions, TSS ) and in situ optical data (Vertical attenuation, water leaving radiance, reflectances, Atmospheric Optical Depth, spectral and single channel absorption and backscattering)."}',

      description:
        'The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia\'s oceans. The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours.  It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.

The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a dissecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.

The phytoplankton abundance data are analysed as per Richardson et al 2006. Phytoplankton are usually counted from water samples after settling but in the CPR analysis we count the phytoplankton in situ. With CPR samples, the phytoplankton is captured by the mesh and are caught by the silk strands, by phytoplankton mucilage, and/or by other organisms on the silk.

It has been shown (Crombie, 1955) that the scatter is predominantly a Bragg interaction between the radio wave and the sea surface gravity wave that is propagating in the same direction and with half the wavelength of the radio wave. This Bragg interaction gives two strong first-order lines in the echo spectrum; one from the resonant gravity wave moving radially away from the station, and one from the resonant gravity wave moving towards the station.\\n\\nDirection-finding systems determine the azimuthal direction of a source point by comparing amplitude and phase signals on crossed loop receive antennas. The direction finding calculation is done on Doppler shift spectra for a specified range which includes return echoes from all azimuths. This means that the spectra are spread and second-order echoes from one direction are swamped by the first-order echoes from other directions. Consequently, parameter extraction using second-order echoes is not possible on a routine basis. Directional wave spectra at the location of each radar station are produced by analysing the full azimuthal spread of first-order echo amplitudes, and wind directions are derived across the grid points by taking the ratio of the positive and negative Bragg echoes.\\n\\nSeaSonde HF ocean radar stations are used on the Turquoise Coast (Seabird and Cervantes), Western Australia, and on the Bonney Coast (Nora Creina and Blackfellows Cave), South Australia."}',

The NRS is located at a convergence point of isobaths and monitors upwelling and outflow events as well as long-term variations in the strength of the coastal current.\\n\\nThere are six discontinued moorings that were once part of this sub-facility, for which data is still available: M1 Deep Slope Mooring (SAM1DS) and M6 Investigator Strait Mooring (SAM6IS) were both discontinued in 2009, M4 Canyon Mooring (SAM4CY) and M2 Cabbage Patch Mooring (SAM2CP) were both discontinued in 2010, and M4 Mid-Slope Mooring (SAM3MS) and M7 Deep-Slope Mooring (SAM7DS) which were discontinued in 2013-2014."}',

        "This dataset describes the logsheet information filled in during sampling at the National Reference (NRS) stations, which comprise part of a broader sampling program carried out within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Nine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW).\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below..\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. \n\nThe main goals of the project are to: 1. Provide a record of physical, chemical and biological (plankton) changes in Australian coastal waters. 2. Record data as part of a larger comprehensive national dataset, comprising both continuous in-situ sampling and analysis of discrete physical, chemical and biological samples collected monthly. \n\n\nPeople using these data should also consider historical data available from three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008 .. MarLIN Record Number: 4849 \nPort Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 .. MarLIN Record Number: 5301 \nRottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009 .. MarLIN Record Number: 4877",

The surveys were conducted as part of a collaboration between the IMOS AUV Facility, the National Environment Research Program (NERP) Theme 1 - National monitoring, evaluation and reporting and NSW DPI Fisheries. Dives focused on a number of reefs in 20 m to 60 m of water depth and consisted of both dense 25 m x 25 m full photo quadrants designed to allow repeat surveys over years and broader surveys up to 2km in length to document habitat distributions over broader scales. Additional scientific operations carried out at these sites include multibeam bathymetry, towed video and Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS)."}',

A significant proportion of South Scott Reef and the adjacent lagoon lies in waters between 30 m to 70 m deep that support a range of habitats similar to many of the submerged shoal systems strung along the edge of the continental shelf in the Timor Sea. The South Scott Reef lagoon covers 300 km^2 and is the largest area of this type observed on a single reef system in the NW region. Understanding the nature and dynamics of these deeper water areas will not only better describe the true extent of Australia’s tropical reef resources, but will contribute to a broader understanding of the overall resilience of coral reefs in the NW region. In order to produce an accurate, high resolution habitat map of the deeper reef waters and to establish viable deep water monitoring sites, high resolution acoustic mapping using digital mulitbeam from Geoscience Australia was completed in parallel with collecting georeferenced seabed images using the AUV Sirius and the existing AIMS towed video with high resolution stills systems. AUV deployments consisted of 19 dives over 12 days of operation onboard the R/V Solander using a mix of survey designs and illustrated the vehicle\'s reliability and versatility as a complementary habitat characterisation tool. On several occasions the vehicle operated beyond tracking range of the supporting vessel for extended periods facilitating the execution of other scientific objectives, particularly swath bathymetric mapping of the Scott Reef lagoon."}',

Although there is extensive monitoring of shallow water reefs along the extent of the GBR, there has been relatively little opportunity to monitor deeper reefs. Understanding the nature of these deepwater reefs may provide important insights into the resilience of the GBR to stresses such as changing temperatures, ocean acidification, cyclones and nutrient influx from the coast. Surveys of the seagrass beds in the lagoon, which were designed to revisit sites surveyed using towed video ten years ago, and at Myrmidon Reef on the outer GBR were completed during July 2011 to establish benthic reference sites in this area."}',
